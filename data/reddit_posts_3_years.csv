This is great for out-of-state or international students, including those who don’t traditionally celebrate American Thanksgiving.   All students are matched with at least one other student and paired with a host. You can indicate if you have transportation, what languages you speak and dietary restrictions you have, and any other information. We will try to make the best pairing for both students and hosts.   Not only is this a fun way to spend Thanksgiving, but this is also a great opportunity to meet people from the larger GT community and make connections that last beyond one dinner. Many people who did the dinner last year still keep in touch with their hosts.   I highly encourage anyone who’s interested to sign up here!

We've summed up the details via [this campus story](https://www.oit.gatech.edu/duo-phone-call-2fa-phase-out), but here are a few key points:  * **Effective Nov. 11:** Duo telephony will no longer be offered as a 2FA method for Georgia Tech users when logging in to OneUSG Connect.  * **Effective Dec. 3:** Duo telephony will no longer be offered as a 2FA method into *any* Georgia Tech login system (Banner, Single-Sign On, Outlook, etc.) * The telephony method will, however, remain an option for user account-recovery in Passport.  * OIT will work with campus members, on a case-by-case basis, if there are circumstances that require their continued use of Duo telephony 2FA.  If you don't use Duo telephony as a 2FA method of choice, great -- there is nothing you need to do! If you *are* a current Duo telephony user, please visit the [Two-Factor Authentication at Georgia Tech website](https://oit.gatech.edu/two-factor-authentication) to learn about alternative methods available to you.   If you may require a telephony exception, have questions about the Duo telephony 2FA sunset, or have questions in general about 2FA options available to protect your campus accounts, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at [support@oit.gatech.edu](mailto:support@oit.gatech.edu).

Unfortunately, things have been really rough since the start. Literally a day before the semester began, some unexpected issues with my housing came up, and I ended up having to live in my car for the first six weeks of the semester. While my housing situation has stabilized now, my commute is about 40 minutes each way (without traffic), which is still adding a lot of stress.  All of this combined has put me in a constant game of catch-up. I’m barely finishing homework on time, and when midterms came around, I had to choose between studying or completing assignments. I’ve been trying really hard to hold everything together, but I feel like I’m slowly losing my grip.  My grades have been slipping, and I’ve had the worst midterm performances of my academic career so far (I got a 51, 70, 73, 70, and 87). I feel like I’m in a hole that’s getting deeper at a rate of 3x, and I can only climb out at 2x. I’m really starting to lose hope and can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Is there anything I can do to maybe buy myself some time, or any steps I can take to get back on track? Any advice would be really appreciated.

t3_1fxabl0,"Student football fans, we have some things to work on","First off, it is amazing we are filling out BOTH endzones. I am so excited about how far we've come. This post is a little bit of venting and some constructive criticism about a few incidents during the Duke game, but overall, it is incredible to see our student body showing out to cheer on the Jackets!  Still, there are a few things we need to improve on to be the fanbase these players deserve.  Most importantly, I think we can all agree that the trash thrown on the field on at least three occasions was completely unacceptable. As a fanbase and school, we have a reputation to develop and uphold, and we will not be like certain other fanbases in our state and conference. If you need a more tangible reason, our team will be penalized during the game and that could result in serious consequences within the game.  Now, I'm sure the assholes actually doing this stuff aren't going to be reading this post. All I ask for from y'all is a zero tolerance for these types of things and make sure ""fans"" like this know that they do not belong in the student section.  On a less serious note, we really need to shut up when our offense is on the field. Chanting and cheering is cool when the stakes aren't too high, but if our team is trying to finish off a drive in the redzone, it does not help when their fans are shouting at them. Consistent homefield advantage is incredibly important and we will desperately need it against Notre Dame and Miami in the coming weeks. Help me out here and let your friends know to quiet down when we have the ball.  On the other hand, we have been fantastic in bringing the noise when we're on defense. Keep that up and turn it up to 11!  Maybe I'm overreacting to some of this stuff, and feel free to call me out if that's the case. This is just an extremely valuable aspect of student life for me and I felt like something needed to be said.  Thank you to all who have been showing out to these games.

With the recent discussion on athletics troubles and career fair issues, I just wanted to publish my thoughts on things I’ve seen happen.  Every year we play at home for the uGA football game, the student section gets flooded and BEST “rent a cops” have always been belligerent to students, blocking them from their seats.  Last year during the UNC football game, students stormed the field. The entire stadium atmosphere changed 1-2 minutes before the end of the game, and it was obvious it was coming. BEST security body checked and tackled the first few field stormers, despite 1000s more behind them. They injured at least 2 doing this, instead of dropping back to protect players and coaching staff.  During a speech by Cabrera about the Israel/Palestine issues, they forcibly detained a Muslim student because he had a picture of a mosque as his phone background.  Just recently, they’ve had pictures posted of their employees falling asleep when they should be checking/guarding bags at the career fair.  I know GTPD doesn’t have the resources to do crowd control for minor events, which sucks since they’re usually pleasant to deal with.

Along with this we also host various social events.  We will have our first meeting this **Monday (09/08) at 7pm in MoSE G011!** We'll introduce ourselves, explain how you can get involved, and discuss future plans. At the end we even have **free pizza** for everyone!  We definitely need a lot of people to accomplish all our goals, so if you're interested in science olympiad or spreading STEM to middle and high schoolers, definitely pull up. Worst case you get some free pizza ;)  If you're interested, you can join our [Engage](https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/science-olympiad) and follow our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gtscioly/) and [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@gtscioly).  **You don't need to have any prior Science Olympiad experience!**  In fact a good amount of our members have never done Science Olympiad (along with a good amount who have done A LOT :)  Hope to see you guys there, and if you have any questions or comments drop them below!!!",penguinothepenguin,1725835463.0,1,0,gatech,Social/Club,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1fcahsz/science_olympiad_gt_sogt_first_meeting_this/
t3_1fbpikb,Is it too late for me to join clubs or do internships?,"As a Junior, I am doing a VIP project for my junior design requirement, and did 2 project based classes. And so far, that's all I have to show for my experience. Do y'all think this should be enough to land an internship some time in 1 to 2 or even 3 years? Or do I need to gain more. If I do need more things on my resume, I know a good place is through student organizations, but I feel that as a junior, and as sort of an antisocial person myself, it's too late and tough for me to work well with others. I know in a CS career, working with others is going to be an important skill, but that's not what I have an issue with. I just don't have any social skills to make friends or have fun properly like others in clubs.

Could be S tier if they had like a 25% sweet option but idk i guess the default is sugar addiction for college students. They froth almond milk so well I could almost mistake it as oat milk because it makes the texture comparably thick. * **B tier:**    * **Kaldi's Coffee:** for the default sweetness, it is b tier because it is still too sweet for no reason * **C tier:**    * **Starbucks:** overpriced for what it is and also still extremely sweet by default, you could get better matcha for less money at kaldi's and gold &amp; bold * **F tier:**    * **Dunkin:** literally the worst matcha you could get. I'm offended they would ever call it a matcha latte because its so terrible, it might as well be a pure sugar drink with 50g of sugar and like 1 single gram of matcha. you can't even adjust the sweetness level because the matcha is mixed with sugar in a pre-made mix. also because its a pre-made mix, the matcha quality is not good at all and not fresh. I'm convinced they put some sort of artificial coloring in there to make it green because its definitely not from the garbage matcha they use  As you can tell I really dislike overly sweet matcha lattes but I think Gold &amp; Bold and Kaldi's is still the best because you can adjust the sweetness as much as you want, whether no sweetener or an insane amount. Dunkin is still terrible though I think their matcha latte should be considered a health hazard.

t3_1eo3gh0,Georgia Tech Financial Aid Advice?,"So I'm a ""fourth-year"" at Georgia Tech and I'm having issues affording the school. Not that we all aren't, but the amount that I get from financial aid should at least cover tuition, but I'm still stuck in the red because of a ""rotating balance"" from 2 years ago. In my 2nd year, my EFC unexpectedly went up, and I had increased my costs by living on campus and taking out a meal plan, and ended up owing around $13,000 to the school. Since financial aid through the school wasn't going to cover that, over the Summer of 2023 I took out a private loan to cover that specific Spring 2023 balance.   However, somewhere along the line, the Financial aid office decided to change the loan terms without my consent to a Fall 23-Spring 24 loan. This meant that the loan would be split in half, going to 2 future semesters, and none of the money would actually go to the semester the loan was originally applied and approved for. Whenever I brought this up to Financial Aid, they told me to speak to my lender about it, but my lender revealed that it was due to how Financial Aid incorrectly certified the loan. Financial Aid then lied and said that I originally applied for a Fa23-Spr24 loan, and lied saying they could not recertify it. This led to my prior balance causing the Bursar to cancel my classes for Fall 23 and Spring 24, while keeping the housing charges tacked on. It was only last semester, Spring 24, when Financial Aid admitted they DID change the loan term themselves, and they COULD recertify the loan, but only wanted to increase my loan to pay even more rather than fixing their mistake. They also canceled my Spring scholarships and grants they originally awarded me as if to wring every penny out of me, as if they were still awarded I could have actually afforded last semester.   I just got my Financial Aid offer TODAY (because any sooner couldn't possibly have been reasonable, right?) and in total, it's barely enough to cover this semester's tuition, much less my past balance that's been dragged forward since last Spring. They discontinued the student access loan, every external scholarship/grant I've applied for I've been rejected or denied for some reason or the other. I've spoken to Financial Aid EXTENSIVELY, the Bursar, the Dean of Students office, the Housing office, my donors, and none of them could help me, and Financial Aid doesn't even seem to care (they don't even use my name in responses, they just refer to me as ""the student"" in replies TO ME).   At this point I just want to know if anyone here has any advice, any contacts, resources, etc. Or just can attest to anything similar? It's just extremely screwed what they've done and, in my opinion, shouldn't be let off the hook, but I can't really do anything about it myself.",dizastermaster7,1723219213.0,21,2,gatech,Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1eo3gh0/georgia_tech_financial_aid_advice/

The former was an absolute train-wreck, not only were we given unfair tests where a a quarter of our grade depended on a multi-step answer with no partial credit. But TAs and Instructors refused to correct (many, many) grading errors, stemming from incorrect grading keys, even after admitting their answers were incorrect or nonsensical. Bummer, I knew the class was hard but was excited to take the topic, I learned more in my internship and free online courses.  6795 is bad in a different way, the material is solid and the class is enjoyable, but extremely luck based. I know a few friends that handed in way better material than me and sadly got lower grades. Grading is pretty vibes based it seems, and there is little to no communication from the teaching team. Bummer, I loved the material but midway through saw most of people I knew in the class stop caring, with the obviously broken grading system in place.  Grades are not everything, take the classes if you want to learn the material but be warned, sometimes your grades will just be.

t3_1d8tvdc,Spring transfer advice: ID or IA?,"  Hello everyone, I am a rising sophomore looking to transfer to tech in the spring semester. Currently I go to a t30 school in the west coast pursuing a major I’m not passionate about, but I would be considering an instate student at tech. I want to study industrial design and have completed all the transfer requirements other than physics. I already spoke with admissions and they told me I could complete it in the fall while I submit my transfer application. I am not good at math or math based sciences, and at my school we have requirements based on different categories and I’ve already fulfilled the category that physics is in. I could still take physics even though I fulfilled the requirement but I’m hesitant because of my math ability and the chances I don’t get accepted. I was wondering if it would be easier for me to apply as an international affairs &amp; modern language major then switch to ID once I get accepted. Or should I just take physics and apply ID?

Thanks!   This is what we developed for a scope of work for the two interns:     1.    Develop an incoming inspection process for items coming from suppliers and vendors that have critical lead times and critical dimensions, and/or high cost.  Ideally, this process would be tied into the Arena Software.     2.    Assist Engineering in redesign of the Assisi Loop Lounge components so that we can add a memory foam layer to the small and medium sized lounges and also that we may send out drawings to new suppliers for quotes.     3.    Setup all Products, Components, BOMs, Assembly Instructions in the new Arena Software.     4.    Create better workstation efficiency with labeled parts bins and tablets and better organization of materials.   Based on these ideas, we are hoping to find candidates that have a strong quality training and some experience with Arena Software, if possible.   Please let me know if you have any questions.   15-20 hours a week $20 an hour 5-6 months (through October)  Interested and Qualified Candidates should email me at:  mleahy@zomedica.com  Mike Leahy Director of Operations  Zomedica, Inc. 4000 Northfield Way Suite 900 Roswell, GA. 30076",No-Maybe-4080,1715358367.0,1,1,gatech,Job Listing,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1cotmso/engineering_students_wanted_for_internship/

t3_1bd9ggk,"Georgia Tech CS: Uninspiring, poorly taught, waste of time","A CS student here. Looking at my classes, I can’t help feeling angry over the amount of time I’ve wasted with these classes.  The CS classes almost all lack depth and any critical thinking in them. The exams are overwhelmingly easy in content, but frustrating that you almost always have to perfect score to receive an A (oh you missed polling “A” instead of “C” from the queue, here’s 10 points off from cascading errors!)  It’s always formulaic: remember XYZ taught in class, replicate that in the exam. There’s no need for any thinking, just rote memorization. I don’t even know why I bother memorizing all these useless facts I can just google search. Projects are also largely handheld, why even bother.  The CS courses themselves are also not well taught, with most of them being some disinterested professor lecturing for an hour. If their primary motivation is research, why force them to teach? It does not take a genius to lecture about undergraduate computer science, and any lecturer with any passion in instruction could do better and cheaper too.  The gen eds are an overwhelming waste of time. Memorizing random art pieces with multiple choice exams sure isn’t how I thought I’d be spending my time. The composition heavy classes also lack any sufficient feedback. How do I learn if I just get a grade a month after I submit my paper with no feedback other than the occasional “this paragraph is too long!!!”  The professors also love forcing you to show effort by mandating attendance to their endless droning.  Worst of all, none of these courses are actually applicable. Just about everything that is useful to my career was taught to myself by myself.   Junior design options are also horrible aside from research, if you are into it. No, I don’t want to work for free for some random company while writing 20 pages of design docs, no I don’t want to waste my time pretending to do something in VIP. Why isn’t there a coop option for junior design so I can actually use this time to get something useful for my resume?  CS education is a joke here, filled with busy work to get some fancy paper.   Georgia tech CS is a failure in education. The only reason why students have good outcomes is because they recruit already accomplished and smart students that do not require an actually decent education.",Severe_Assignment,1710279606.0,1,0,gatech,Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1bd9ggk/georgia_tech_cs_uninspiring_poorly_taught_waste/

t3_1an4674,What to do about an unresponsive prof,"I'm in a project based class and having trouble communicating at all with my prof. My groupmate emailed them (on a Friday) for the first big assignment (due on a Monday) because there was no rubric or real guidelines posted for it. No response, and we all got docked off 10%+ for not including items that were never specified to us. Only feedback was to ""answer more specifically"".   This week, we have a pretty critical discrepancy in our results ie it makes no physical sense. We group emailed the TA and prof on Wednesday, only got a response from the TA saying they were unsure and asking the prof if they have any ideas. We emailed back to the group email both yesterday and today, still no response from prof. This assignment is also due Monday before class, which is the only time we see the prof in person.   Office hours are by appointment only, which is kind of difficult to schedule if we just get ghosted by email. I pulled up to their office a couple times and they were not there. We're just gonna have to BS this assignment and chalk it up to human errors probably, even though I'm 99% sure there's more to it than that. But in the future, how do we deal with an unresponsive prof if the TA is unable to help? Just deal and survive the semester? Anyone else we can go to outside of the instructional team?

I went in person to see my advisor and they weren't even in person today. The guy at the front desk told me on my advisor can do anything about my registration stuff.

t3_193d16u,"Don't let your Football hype die down, Join the International Simulation Football League!","First off, I want to thank the r/GaTech mod team for allowing this post! With all the hype our team has gotten over this last season after finally ditching G**** and getting our first bowl win since 2016 I wanted to give y'all a way to keep the hype going into the Offseason. I joined this league back in March of last year and have really enjoyed it. Though there are some uGA fans in the league so it would be nice to have a few more GT people to help balance it out.  The 45th season of the International Simulation Football League is wrapping up, which means that it is a great time to create a player and join! The ISFL is a free online sim league where you create a professional football player and control their journey through the pros from pre-draft to retirement. With over 30 player archetypes to choose from, you can be anything from a pass-catching running back to a ball hawking safety or even a strong legged kicker.   Your player will compete in games (simulated using Draft Day Sports: Pro Football 2021) throughout the week that premiere on [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@ISFL) nightly. Each 16-game season lasts about 6 weeks, including playoffs, followed by a 2 week offseason. Complete stats are recorded on the [league index](https://index.sim-football.com/ISFLS45/), and we also have cool user-made tools to keep track of [historical records](https://isfl-bot.herokuapp.com/) and [our very own Hall of Fame](https://wiki.sim-football.com/view/List_of_ISFL_Hall_of_Fame_inductees).  With hundreds of players and over 20 teams across the developmental and major leagues, the ISFL is also an active online community. Joining a team is not only a chance to see your player succeed, but also to hang out with fellow users in the Discord server that serves as your team’s locker room. You’ll be joining a tight-knit group of like-minded people who enjoy getting a bit nerdy about football and root together for your players when they take the simulated field.  ## Sounds Great! How Do I Start?  If you want to jump in right away, a great place to start is to join the [ISFL Rookie Discord](https://discord.gg/mPHkNKcWdH). Our team of rookie mentors will be happy to answer any questions and assist you with creating your player and getting started on your ISFL career! If you want to read more about the process first, we have a great [Rookie Guide](https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=6235) written up on the league forums and a [series of tutorial videos on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCr9BsbjaE3qnGZ9ZX54rVZIRWtu5bHbi&amp;si=aIVhYe_w70l3IdWj) as well to walk you through the player creation process.  ## What Happens After I Create My Player?  After making your player, you'll be scouted by teams that are entirely run by other users in the league and drafted to a developmental team in the DSFL Draft on Thursday, January 25. Just like the games, the YouTube channel streams all our offseason events including drafts, awards shows, and the Prospect Bowl that your new player will compete in!  During your player’s career, you can improve their attributes by spending 10-15 minutes completing optional tasks each week, like predicting the winners of each game or mocking the 1st round of the draft. The league is 100% free - there is no ""pay to win"" and nothing costs real money to unlock. You will earn fake league currency through your player's contracts or through creating content like written articles, graphics, or podcasts. You can use it to further upgrade your player and do fun things like collecting trading cards of ISFL players!  ## Quick Links  Thanks for reading!

t3_17vz5vr,Cabrera finally responds to BOTH the Islamophobia and antisemitism students have been facing,"Link: [Cabrera Blog Post](https://president.gatech.edu/blog/caring-our-campus-community?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=https%3A//president.gatech.edu/blog/caring-our-campus-community%20%5BOutlook%20Button%5D&amp;utm_campaign=Daily%20Digest%20-%20Nov.%2015%2C%202023)  The conversations I have had over the past couple of days at the annual conference of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities highlighted the extent to which the situation in Gaza and Israel is affecting campuses across the country. I heard many university leaders share stories about the pain and anxiety experienced by students, faculty, and staff on their campuses; about conflict among members of their communities; and about the worrisome growth in incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia.    The Georgia Tech community is no different. In my meetings over the last month with Jewish and Muslim student leaders, as well as with faculty and staff colleagues, it’s clear our community is experiencing anguish over the loss of human life in Gaza and Israel, anxiety about the future of the impacted communities, and fear of increased antisemitism and Islamophobia right here at home. These concerns are felt even more acutely by those with personal, family, cultural, or faith ties with the Middle East and by those who may be targets of discrimination because of their background.    There’s much we can do as a university to support our community. First and foremost, we will do everything in our power to keep everyone safe. The Georgia Tech Police Department and Student Engagement and Well-Being have worked diligently to address incidents of harassment, vandalism, or violence in our community and will continue to do so. It is important that we all help them do their work: If you experience or witness any action that concerns you, please [report](https://police.gatech.edu/) it.   Second, I encourage all of us to learn more about the history and reality of antisemitism and Islamophobia and reflect on how to combat them. I have attended sessions at higher education conferences on this subject and spoken to leaders in various relevant organizations. I have studied communications from the White House and the U.S. Department of Education about our obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I regularly meet with colleagues and students at Georgia Tech and elsewhere who have been on the receiving end of hate and harassment to try to learn as much as I can.   Third, we need to support those among us who need help. I ask all members of our Georgia Tech community to extend empathy, compassion, and care to our students during this challenging time. In the spirit of shared humanity, we need to acknowledge the lives lost in both Israel and Gaza, which is now facing a significant humanitarian crisis. If any student is experiencing anxiety, stress, or simply wishes to talk with someone who can help, we have counselors available to support your emotional and mental well-being through [Student Engagement and Well-Being](https://mentalhealth.gatech.edu/). Many members of our faculty and staff are also experiencing anxiety related to these events. We have support services available through our [Employee Assistance Program](https://hr.gatech.edu/eap), and I encourage anyone to access them if you need help.    Lastly, I hope we can provide an example to the rest of our community of civil, respectful, and peaceful expression of ideas. As a university, Georgia Tech does not hold or profess any specific position on this or other complex geopolitical issues. But the members of our community do. It is our responsibility to create an environment where everyone can freely express their views and have an opportunity to engage in respectful dialogue with others. The right to free speech on a public university campus like ours is broad and protects even forms of expression that may appear offensive to some. I urge everyone to use that right judiciously and compassionately.   These heartbreaking events underline the vital role Georgia Tech plays in helping build a better world for all. Every day, I am inspired by the ideas coming out of our labs and the ingenuity and leadership of our students. Our mission to develop leaders who can improve the human condition through the power of innovation has never been more important.",Pretty-Lawfulness-64,1700070423.0,1,1,gatech,News,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17vz5vr/cabrera_finally_responds_to_both_the_islamophobia/

I was too lazy to parse this out so they are not included.  * Outdoor Recreation/CRC, DramaTech, and SOFO: These totals include people's salaries as well as line items for maintenance of the climbing wall in some cases. Again, too lazy to parse this out. * Office of Student Media, Student Center, Student Engagement, Student Life: Pretty sure these are campus departments that use some money from the student activity fee but aren't actually RSOs.

t3_17ux21x,SGA aims to destroy engineering organizations,"**TLDR: If you are part of a student organization with a budget, this affects you! Come out tonight (11/14) at 7:30pm to the Flag Building (Smithgall Student Services Building) and let SGA know cutting the budget of your RSO is NOT OK!**      A proposed new limit on student org spending will take the max budget from $122k down to $34k. While this new number may still seem like a lot, it will severely limit the capabilities of many technical clubs on campus that depend on large budgets from SGA to facilitate incredible projects that help our students grow as engineers.     I am part of one of these clubs, though for anonymity will not say which. This limit will make our current projects and long-term goals completely unachievable.     Technical student orgs serve hundreds of students by providing meaningful projects where we can grow as engineers. If you ask current members and alumni, they will all tell you that the work they did in their clubs was pivotal in getting them the internships and full-time jobs that GT PR always boasts about.   Having spoken with a tour guide, the most positive interest and engagement from prospective Tech students comes when discussing the various technical clubs on campus. Will these students be more or less likely to come to GT over MIT, Stanford, UM, or any other university if they know Tech is actively decreasing support for these clubs? I think the answer is clear.      Tech loves to highlight the many undergraduate research opportunities available. Why do these opportunities exist? Because of the large monetary support that the labs at Tech receive. Without sufficient funding, the scope of research at Tech would dramatically decrease, and the interesting projects that so many students enjoy, learn, and find industry opportunities from would decrease. The same philosophy applies to technical student orgs. Furthermore, clubs tend to reach students traditionally underrepresented or legally barred from performing research at Tech - eliminating these opportunities would disproportionately impact their ability to grow as professionals and achieve their career goals.      As a school we should strive to encourage talented and motivated individuals to continue coming to Tech. We all have a career interest in ensuring GT remains a highly regarded institution that continues on the path of building great engineers.     By limiting the technical student orgs, we send the entirely wrong message: “Tech limits student innovation.”     Tonight (11/14) at 7:30pm SGA will be having an open forum and presentation of the new policy. I encourage anyone and everyone who wants GT to continue supporting technical clubs to show up and speak up. The meeting is at the Flag Building (Smithgall Student Services Building).     I know for those not in these clubs, these budgets may seem exorbitant, but real technical projects cost real money. I cannot emphasize enough how important these clubs are to countless students here, both in school experience and in technical growth. If you care about supporting the goals of your friends and future students and ensuring GT remains one of the best engineering schools in the country, please come out in support.

He is also a Heisman voter.  **Ken Sugiura (**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ksugiuraajc)**) -** Ken Sugiura is GT's Atlanta journal constitution sports writer, his tweets are typically brief but follow all aspects of GT athletics (From gossip, administration, and all GT sports) Kelly typically tweets about it.   &amp;#x200B;  **Commercial GT fan accounts:**  *These are more commercial GT accounts, meaning that they regularly advertise on their pages but have better presences online. For example, you're probably familiar with both the GT Barstool and Red Cup account already.*     **Barstool Georgia Tech** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/BarstoolGT) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gtbarstool/)) - The largest and most well known GT 'fun' account. Typically covers all things Tech, and is a direct affiliate of Barstool Sports. Submissions can be sent in via DM's.  **Red Cup Georgia Tech** ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/redcupgt/)) - Similar to GT Barstool, and is a direct affiliate of Red Cup News. Submission can be sent in via DM's, and are typically more active online than the GT Barstool account.  **thegtloop** ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thegtloop/)) - A new GT instagram account, similar to both Red Cup and Barstool. I'm not sure if they're an affiliate of anyone in general, but typically advertise a lot more than either the Red Cup or Barstool account. For that reason, I felt comfortable placing them here on this list. They're content is mostly reposts of TikTok's and Reels relating to GT, but it's still a fun account to follow!  **Old Row Georgia Tech** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/OldRowGATech) / [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oldrowgatech/)) - Hasn't been active in months, but was a very fun account to follow. Typically covers Greek life, and is a direct affiliate of Old Row. Submissions can be sent in via DM's, however it's unlikely that they'll respond since they haven't been active in months at the time of me writing this.  &amp;#x200B;  That's pretty much everyone that I know of!

t3_16im9t9,Is grad school meant to be this hard? Asking for advice," I'm currently in grad school and feeling overwhelmed by the workload, especially when it comes to group projects. I'll provide some context to give you a better idea of what I'm dealing with:  For context, I did my undergrad at Georgia Tech and took about 17 credits every semester while working a part-time job was heavily involved in on-campus clubs, and held leadership positions. I also had multiple internships and graduated with highest honors. Essentially I'm used to working extremely hard but keeping up what I need to do while maintaining a work-life balance.  However, grad school is killing me and I'm not sure how to handle it. I meant to do 20 hours of research a week and I also have 15 hours of classes a week on top of that every single class I'm in has a very large group project with a randomly assigned group. All the meetings for these projects and doing work for them it come out to about 30 hours of class work a week. Is it normal for grad students to do over 60 hours of work a week this seems really excessive and it's been very stressful for me. I love the work I'm doing but I also love having hobbies and sleeping 8 hours a night.  I simultaneously feel like I'm letting everyone down and pulling all of these projects. For my research, I'm definitely not doing 20 hours I'm doing more like 10 but when I present the work I've done my group acts like I've done more than they expected me to do.  And then all of my group projects I feel incredibly stressed and like the deadlines are super soon and I haven't done enough to meet the deadlines or pull my weight but then I've done significantly more than any of my group members. And I'm not quite sure how to handle these group dynamics because people keep telling me I'm not doing enough but then they'll have done literally nothing.  For example one group I'm in wanted these slides done tonight by about 5:00 PM and my group members were really on to me about making sure I have my stuff done. All of my slides were done but I needed to add images and sources for them meanwhile everyone else had barely started.  Another project I'm in is a partner project and this girl didn't show up to the first two meetings I scheduled for us to meet and discuss the project, she said she was available and would show up I just sat around waiting for her. She told me she had no Excel experience so I needed to do that part of the project. For reference, the project is creating a tool in Excel and then documenting and testing that tool and writing about it in a 35-page report. So, I pretty much felt like she was asking me to do it all by myself. Then after class yesterday she came up to me and asked me when I thought the tool would be done. Because she had heard that other groups had finished making their tool. I literally wanted to explode because maybe the tool would have been done if we weren't behind a week because she missed our first two meetings or maybe the tool would be done if she had put in literally any work into this project.  I just don't know how to deal with group projects like this and I feel like grad students aren't meant to work over 60 hours a week but everyone is making me do their work for them and I’m not a pushover but people are literally refusing to do much of anything it feels like. And if this was in one project fine but this is in four projects that are all due very soon and I cannot carry four group projects on my own.  Any advice on how to handle this situation or if this is normal would be very appreciated.",The_Lithuanian,1694707443.0,1,0,gatech,Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/16im9t9/is_grad_school_meant_to_be_this_hard_asking_for/
t3_16ik7a7,Any CS majors with C++ experience for Mac willing to help an alum fix a bug in a side project (for money)? Trying to figure out why my code isn't working and not sure where to go for help,"Hey all,  I graduated a few years ago, but this is the sort of question I would ask around the CoC if I were still on campus so I'm hoping it's allowed on this sub lol.  Part of a program I am trying to write is supposed to continuously fetch all system audio from the macOS default output into a ring buffer. I believe I have set up an audio unit that should do this, but when I check the render callback that is attached to the audio unit I created, the data buffer is full of zeroes. I can't figure out why I'm not getting any audio - it doesn't work with the system default output nor with [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)when I tried that. I'm looking for anyone who can figure out Apple CoreAudio Audio Units to help me figure out how to get the data I'm looking for.  Any CS majors willing to take a look? I've been stuck for like a week. **I'm willing to venmo $100 to anyone who can get me unstuck** lol, once I can load system audio into my buffer I think I should be good to go.

Since I am running out of time in undergrad, should I take the random group assignment (I am assuming this is what happens), or should I wait a semester and find a group or a research project to pursue?

t3_152bud8,Grad School and Alternative Options,"Throw-away account in case I am an outlier occurrence.  I am finally getting out this fall, and I have been planning to get at least an ME master's degree from Tech before jumping into industry work for a few years now, but when I look back at my journey through undergrad, my chances don't look super hot. For reasons I can only assume to be related to neurodivergence, I sucked at standard lecture-style classes, particularly testing (project based learning was much more my style). Also, I only recently narrowed down what fields I am genuinely interested in, but I likely will only be able to spend one semester at most working in research for one of them. My GPA definitely isn't anywhere near the 3.3 that they want, let alone above 3.0 (not that low, but not what they want, either), plus I didn't do much in college to put myself out there besides some school of music stuff. It doesn't feel right for me to not apply at all (Spring 2024), though, and I would greatly prefer to remain at Tech rather than go anywhere out of state (or Atlanta, for that matter).   Is there anything I could possibly do now to increase my chances of getting in on the first go even with a not so great GPA? And in the event that I do get rejected, what would be my next steps? Could I work in industry for a couple years, then apply again? If so, then what would graduate admissions be looking for at that point, since I would have held a job or even an internship by the time I tried again? I really want to try for admission even now, but I want to have backup plans going in case I do not make it.",Toss_It13579,1689623068.0,9,6,gatech,Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/152bud8/grad_school_and_alternative_options/

t3_150t2wm,Am I crazy for not wanting to go here?,"For reference: I just transferred this summer as an engineering major.  I have always wanted to go to GT. I'm out of state. Money isn't an issue(not really anyways)  I transferred from another T20 engineering university(think uw madison purdue etc) where I was doing amazing in all aspects. I don't know if I want to start it all over even though I've always wanted to go here. It isn't the academics or opportunities that's dissuading me obviously.. It's not that it would be difficult, even though I'm sure it is hard as hell. I just don't know if its worth being in a rat race for even LONGER as most people are graduating in 5-6 years for engineering from my brief survey of people. It seems harder to meet people through classes and people in general seem kinda reserved. I was also super into a bigger city vibe but I don't have a car and my experiences with MARTA so far have been pretty meh honestly. Maybe I am overreacting but I feel like I would be starting over again at a (somewhat) lateral move that I wouldn't really need to still do well in life. GT has so many great opportunities but I'm not sure I would miss out on anything as I'm smart enough to get a high paying job regardless of the degree I would get and was already at a well renowned university. Maybe its just transfer student stigma but I've met some other transfer students and there are sooooo few comparatively that are in the same situation I am in being out of state. A ton of them are just coming from GSU or UGA and commuting which makes it super hard to make connections with other transfer students or in general.     Yes this is a great school academically but it just seems pretty dull in other aspects compared to a lot of other big schools. I do want to enjoy my time in college, or at least have it be tolerable and I'm not sure that is something I factored in when thinking I want to come here. Maybe this is just a pointless shout into space and everything will be ok but I am really questioning myself here.

t3_14xaqh3,Academy of Medicine Parking Lot/PTS Rant,"PTS is horrible but this post isn't really about that, that's more than been discussed already. Instead I have something to say about the academy of medicine parking lot- could we please get the smallest amount of enforcement there, by both PTS and GTPD? The vast majority of the people that park there don't have passes/aren't paying according to a GTPD officer I talked to, and I don't think that's fair to people who do pay the ridiculous 800/yr for just one zone from 8-5. In addition, it's in a significantly more dangerous location than campus, so if anything it should be even more overpoliced than campus is. Although there's definitely something to complain about with having too many PTS people and false tickets and stuff that occurs on campus, the other side of that (nobody checking at all) is worse IMO. GTPD told me that's what's going on (nobody checks this lot) after I found my car broken into a couple days ago before heading to work, which although annoying I can't say I found surprising given that a parking space was filled with broken glass for an entire month before they cleaned it up earlier today (they had a summer start-up event today that they zoned the lot off for, figure that's what got them to finally clean it).   Obviously PTS gives no fucks about what people think (did anything ever happen as a result of that SGA investigation?), but hey maybe this will let students know that if they have a car with bulletproof windows they can park in that lot and not worry about getting ticketed.",Johnonike,1689127409.0,13,5,gatech,Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/14xaqh3/academy_of_medicine_parking_lotpts_rant/

t3_14allju,"As a continued protest against Reddit's API changes, we are implementing ""Touch Grass Tuesdays""","As the blackout approached the end date, we began looking at what to do as a next step. Some subreddits are staying dark indefinitely, including many large subreddits such as r/music and r/videos.  This subreddit, however, is not well suited to remain private indefinitely. A lot of people use r/gatech for information or advice that is important to their education and college life. **We're not going to take that away.** At the same time, some of you noted protests work best when there is no end date. There won't be one.  The biggest impact the blackout has made so far is to cause concern among companies who advertise on Reddit. What we intend to do is to follow hundreds of other subreddits in hitting advertising revenue *again* while maintaining the community's usability. Starting from next week, **the subreddit will be private again every Tuesday**, the day with the highest ad revenue / ROI, in a protest movement called “Touch Grass Tuesday”. You will not be able to access the sub on that day - but we will return the day after. The aim is to confirm the advertising companies' concerns by causing the highest profit loss to disruption ratio, in a sustainable, ongoing way and we intend to continue this until the situation improves.  We aim to balance our individual community’s interest with the larger sitewide problems, and we are reading your input on Discord and elsewhere, so please let us know your thoughts. As always, as a small-sized sub, we follow the direction of the larger mod community: our protest will end when demands are met, when directed by the larger leadership, or when unable to continue.

t3_145cs2c,We’re joining the Reddit blackout from June 12th to 14th to protest the planned API changes that will kill 3rd party apps,"Howdy r/gatech  It’s been a minute since we had one of these mod posts, as this is mostly a pretty tight knit, drama free community. I’m sure you’ve read half a dozen of these by now, but it’s worth stating our participation and support of the blackout put on by subreddits across this site.  Recently Reddit corporate has announced changes to the API pricing structure that would effectively kill every 3rd party application used to access the site. Apps like Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Narwhal, and others will no longer work as they will now cost literal millions to operate in overhead costs.  Here’s a good TLDR on some of the other impacts of this API change, including that it'll break screen readers for the seeing impaired: https://i.imgur.com/E7jSWf1.jpg  Many of the bots that have been in use on this subreddit such as the GT risk bot will no longer be operational either.  **Why should GT care?**  It wasn’t that long ago that I was a wee little first year sitting in Under the Couch building my first API scraper using the reddit API, and these little projects helped solidify my choice of major and lead to the career I have today. I gave presentations to my previous company on the robustness of this API.  If you care about open source software, about a free and open internet, and about the ability to post, this is important. It’s hard not to sound like a boomer a bit here, but the internet is nowhere near as open as it was when I was young and this balkanization seems only likely to continue as corporations in pursuit of infinite growth look to further monetize their user bases.  Will this blackout fix things? Judging by the last one, probably not. But this is really all we can do. I’ve done my part to be amongst the least valuable Daily Active Userbase of all social media sites, but if they want to show us the door, who are we to disagree?  **What you can do**  While subs going dark is one thing, regular users can help as well.  Reach out to Reddit via the channels available to you: Modmail [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit), comment in relevant posts regarding the API changes, submit your comments via the contact forms.  Spread the word about the changes and the consequences where you can. Doesn't have to be on Reddit. The important thing is getting it attention.  Participate in the communities that highlight this issue: [r/Save3rdPartyApps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps), [r/apolloapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp), [r/redditisfun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun), [r/getnarwhal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/)  And finally stay off Reddit completely from June 12th to 14th. The blackout is one thing, but users staying away from the site entirely will send an equally important message.  But don't forget: Don't be a jerk. As frustrating as this is, being toxic or aggressive is not the way to go. Remember the human on the other side of the screen.",TehAlpacalypse,1686335088.0,188,49,gatech,Announcement,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/145cs2c/were_joining_the_reddit_blackout_from_june_12th/

t3_144zp39,Career/Academic Path Advice for a Computer Engineering Major,"Hello everyone,  I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech with a focus on Distributed Systems &amp; Software Design and Devices. I hold a 3.95 GPA and am also pursuing a dual degree program with Emory University, studying Physics (3.90 GPA).  I have completed two internships in China related to computer vision and autonomous driving. In the former, I utilized YOLOv5 to train a license plate detection model, and in the latter, I worked on improving the occupancy network and am expecting to submit a paper to CVPR and got a strong recommendation letter from the CEO.  In addition to my internships, I have ongoing research experience in human activity recognition, with plans to submit a paper to CVPR (also a recommendation letter if everything goes well). I've also completed three course projects and am currently working on a senior design project related to indoor localization.  My future plan involves either working in the US or pursuing graduate studies. While Georgia Tech offers a BS/MS program, I'm considering applying to other schools like CMU, Stanford, and Berkeley for potentially better employment prospects.  Despite my Computer Engineering major, I've learned more towards computer science in terms of coursework and internship experience. Now, I'm unsure whether I should apply for ECE or CS programs for grad school.  Given my background, what would you recommend? ECE or CS? Additionally, do you have any specific advice regarding the grad school application process, particularly for top schools?

The class is only once a week from 5 to a little after 9, so I had originally thought that it wouldn't be too much trouble. The teacher is great, and the assignments aren't too bad, but I had no idea how exhausting it would be to come home from work and do more homework or go straight to school. I also just finished moving, so unpacking and moving around furniture takes up the rest of my free-time. This is a company I'd really like to work for, so I can't afford to slack, but I'm worried that withdrawing from this class would put too much pressure on me during my last semester. Since I've been at Tech, I've only ever taken 12-14 credit hours a semester and have no idea how much pressure it would be to jump up to 17.

Currently, my dream schools are Berkeley, CMU, Stanford, Cornell, and Princeton. Although I have Georgia Tech as my back up, I'm looking into other schools as well. As far as I'm aware, there are three important factors - GPA, Research experience, and TA experience. I will have around 3.9x GPA by end of next semester, and I will have 4 semesters of TA experience by the time I graduate (2 semesters of lower division, and 2 semesters of upper division courses). I don't have any research experience, which is my biggest drawback. I've been reaching out to some professors at my school about research opportunities, so hopefully I can participate in a research by upcoming fall.   For those who went through grad admission recently, could you please give me some advice on how to improve my chances at those top schools, as well as your personal experience on admissions?

t3_13kns3d,"With the ACC on the verge of collapse, where do you think Georgia Tech will stand when it all settles?","[With the ACC in shambles, and FSU/Clemson wanting to either pull out, or force us to sign onto an unequal revenue sharing agreement](https://www.on3.com/teams/kentucky-wildcats/news/acc-schools-considering-departure-from-the-conference/). I'm interested in knowing what other Yellow Jackets feel about the situation - and how y'all think we should proceed forward!  If the ACC survives, but with an unequal revenue agreement - I'm seriously worried about the future of Tech's programs. Considering unequal revenue sharing is what doomed the Big East, I don't see Tech's already cash strapped programs doing any better here than before. Not to mention, what makes the SEC/B1G so successful is the fact that they *don't do unequal revenue sharing*.  *I personally would love to see us return to the SEC*, since our biggest historical rivalries (besides u\[sic\]GA) are with Auburn and Vanderbilt. And, geographically speaking, it would just make more sense for us to commute to teams the next state over - rather than across the country. [There already seems to be some (admittedly) limited support from fans of the penal colony upstate](https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/guest-column-georgia-tech-to-the-sec/article_d4fa2f86-06da-11ed-84e1-c7aa27eceb89.html) to see us return to the conference we helped co-found. And the SEC could also stand to gain a lot with a new [AAU](https://www.aau.edu/who-we-are/our-members) school too, which could help to lessen their appearance of a 'conference of party schools'.  Unrelated - but the SEC could also send an invite to Tulane too! Which has the same possibility of also helping the SEC's reputation, and would be yet another co-founding member to return!  Besides the SEC, the B1G makes the next most sense as they're already the second most academically prestigious P5 athletic conference in the USA behind the ACC. Although, we would have the same issue with the ACC, of having to commute across the country to play teams we have no history with. At least if this were to happen we could say that we didn't have to sacrifice academics for athletics.  The Big 12 would be an okay middle ground, we would be playing teams we again have no connection with and are really far away - but at least we'd get paid more than we are now!  I hate to say it, but I think we also need to consider the possibility of getting downgraded to a G5 conference too. Tech hasn't done super well in recent years, thanks in no small part to the ""[minister of mayhem](https://twitter.com/tori_mcelhaney/status/1170521351997857792?s=20)"", but I'm hopeful that Coach Key can get us moving in a better direction quickly! If this is the case, and we do get left behind, my money is on the American conference - since they're probably looking to expand into a state they've got no footprint in already. I doubt the Sun Belt conference would want us considering they've already got both GSU's.  The last (and most unlikely) scenario I see as a possibility, would be the PAC-12 and (what's left of) the ACC merging into a super conference. [One of my favorite Georgia Tech Sports Youtubers ""Wreck-Talk"" did a video a couple weeks ago about this possible megaconference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WysHlt79jkc) \- he made some really interesting arguments and moves so I'd highly recommend y'all check him out in case you're interested in what this would look like!  Regardless, I'm definitely worried about the future of collegiate sports - since it seems like everything has become about money these last couple years. And media corporations are willing to destroy historic rivalries between schools, just for the sake of making themselves a few more bucks at the end of the year.  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR:  Best case: SEC/B1G  Worst case: AAC  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **EDIT (05/24/23)** \- [Seems like the ACC still has a little time left before the reaper comes knocking, so crisis averted](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/13r2t36/acc_approves_new_revenue_distribution_model/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)?",rockenman1234,1684382269.0,72,64,gatech,Sports,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/13kns3d/with_the_acc_on_the_verge_of_collapse_where_do/

t3_13imi7j,"As a transfer, will I lose HOPE due to GA Tech discarding a year worth of credits?","So, the question's in the header. I transferred to GA Tech after my freshman year. As someone here may know, HOPE counts not just hours at current college, but all hours ever taken at any school.  GA Tech discarded around 25 credit hours when I transferred by either counting them as ""free electives"" worth 1 credit hour instead of 3, or completely ignoring them. The exact number is now hard to measure since the [HOPE website](https://www.gafutures.org/hope-state-aid-programs/hope-zell-miller-scholarships/hope-scholarship/academic-eligibility-in-college/) claims that even if the university didn't transfer a certain class, it is still counted in attempted hours.   Now, I need 126 hours to complete my degree. Does it mean that my last year will not be covered? Since I'll complete 126 credits to complete the degree + 25 throw-away credits of classes that I had to retake or get counted as electives at 1/3 of their credit hours?  Did I misunderstand something? If not, what do I do? There has to be some procedure/way to get funding since transfers are so common here...     UPD:  So, for reasons I don't exactly know, I have way less credit hours than I thought on file. Even less than just what I took at Tech. I can only guess, but I now recall that they may have stated that they only count valuable classes. Stuff like, say, Health or History of Anime may get discarded (no offense towards Health majors if they exist). That is likely how I have so few credits, and it is very likely that this will be the same for many others who end up reading this post.

Its eyes are the cold, lifeless screens, Showing no seats left, crushing dreams, Of those who need this class to graduate, But now, it seems, they'll have to wait.  Its breath is the frustrating glitches, That make students feel like witches, Unable to cast a spell or change their fate, For the registration monster has sealed their date.  And when the semester starts to near, The monster grows and feeds on fear, Of those who still can't find a seat, Forced to face another defeat.

t3_12pvumo,are there any drawbacks to attending FYSA (gt europe)?,"I was really surprised to get an invitation. although I’m sure they send invitations to a lot more students than the 50 who actually attend, I hadn’t actually wrote an essay in my FYSA application when they sent me the invite. I’m an international student so the cost of attending FYSA vs starting school in fall is comparable. Are there any drawbacks to attending FYSA?  Some drawbacks I’m thinking of (please rebut me if they’re wrong or if they’re right, how badly will they affect me and how to circumvent them): 1. Friends  I know that the FYSA cohort will probably be closely knit, but what if there aren’t many from my major? Are there many international students amongst the 50?  2. Extracurriculars Will I miss out on being involved in clubs/sports/research/other commitments at GT? Is it difficult to hop aboard after coming back from GTE?  3. Professors and faculty  Will I limit my interaction with the GT faculty and miss opportunities to connect with my professors? This sounds so suck up and I know that even if I’m in GT it’s such a big school that they probably STILL won’t know me but the FOMO is still real 4. Classes Will FYSA affect the number of credit hours I can complete in the first semester? Am I able to overload? Am I able to overload in GT in general? 5. Other LLCs How does it compare to the Honours Program or the Grand Challenges LLC? Would any be more preferable over the others?   Sorry I hope I don’t sound too clueless! I’m really excited and also kinda nervous for school to start.

t3_11wxme2,Tech Hero Defeats Monster - ChatGPT does Beowulf,"So I asked ChatGPT to write a story about GT but in the style of Beowulf. Turned out kinda amazingly!  &amp;#x200B;  Listen, ye noble souls, to the tale of Georgia Tech, A grand institution, a marvel of intellect, Where students and scholars from far and wide, Came to seek knowledge, and wisdom, and pride.  In the land of Georgia, where the Peachtree blooms, Stood the mighty campus, with its grand halls and rooms, And in the heart of this place, there lay a challenge, A task so daunting, it made the bravest men cringe.  For deep in the bowels of the Institute's lair, Lurked a beast so fearsome, it gave all pause to stare, A monster of code, a creature of steel, Whose power was mighty, whose wrath could kill.  Its name was Wreck, and it roamed the land, With a hunger for knowledge, and a thirst for demand, It devoured all who crossed its path, And left nothing behind, but the aftermath.  But in the face of this danger, there arose a hero, A brave Yellow Jacket, with a heart pure and zero, He wielded a weapon, so fearsome and true, That none could withstand, its power to subdue.  His name was Buzz, and he rode on the wind, A force to be reckoned, a foe to rescind, With his wings of gold, and his stinger so sharp, He faced the great Wreck, and struck like a harp.  The battle was fierce, the clash of the titans, The sound of the struggle, like the rumble of sirens, But in the end, it was Buzz who prevailed, And Wreck was defeated, its terror curtailed.  And so, the legend of Georgia Tech was born, A tale of valor, of courage, and of scorn, Of how one brave soul, with his heart pure and right, Faced a monster so fearsome, and won the great fight.  And now, the students of Georgia Tech, Look upon Buzz with awe and respect, For they know that in him, lies the heart of a true, A hero of legend, a Yellow Jacket through and through.",jvpjr77,1679349853,57,6,gatech,Meme/Shitpost,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/11wxme2/tech_hero_defeats_monster_chatgpt_does_beowulf/

t3_11wlz8u,hesitant to accept admit for MS HCI because I'm trans,"Basically, I got admitted to the MS HCI program at Georgia Tech and I'm super happy about it, however I'm hesitant to accept the admit because of the current political climate in Georgia. The main reason I want to go to GT is because I can get funding as a GRA/GTA (I'm pretty confident I can get a GRA position since I have had done a lot of research projects/publications in undergrad) and won't really have to borrow much in student loans. The program is really aligned with my academic interests and I'm really interested some of the research here.  My other option is University of Washington MS HCDE, however there doesn't seem to be any funding opportunities and I'd have to borrow $60k-$80k for tuition and housing for the entire program. Both programs seem to be excellent so I'm having a hard time choosing which one to go with.  I know that the city of Atlanta itself is pretty LGBTQ+ friendly, however it is still subject to Georgia law. I am aware they're trying to pass bills that restrict gender affirming healthcare for minors in Georgia. Of course I am already 22 so that shouldn't affect me, but I know that could very well change in the future since some other states are trying to ban gender affirming healthcare up to 25-26 years old. The program is 2 years long so I'm not sure how much will change until then. I don't really feel like I want to try to smuggle testosterone from my home state if that ever does happen.  However, UW is in Seattle and it seems like they are much more LGBTQ+ friendly and I wouldn't definitely not have any issues getting healthcare there.  Are my fears irrational? I've never lived in Atlanta/Georgia so I have no idea I'm just overreacting. I'd really like to not have much student loans but I don't know how much risk there is in living in Georgia as an openly trans person. What are current students' experiences/thoughts on this issue?",bx410,1679326491,7,23,gatech,Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/11wlz8u/hesitant_to_accept_admit_for_ms_hci_because_im/

People either end up butchering it or ask me to repeat it at least 3 times, and still get it wrong. I went 20 years without ever having a problem with my name, but coming here this has led to a very conscious change in my social interactions. At a certain point in my friendships here mostly everyone ends up asking me what it means or teach them again. I do understand that not everyone is aware of the particular name, which I do not want to reveal here for anonymity, and is not to blame. But being on the recieving end of this it is very annoying to the point that I am very conscious when introducing myself to anyone, even at career fair it has been a source of embarrassment.

t3_113x04o,What are typical sublease terms?,"I am living off-campus and am trying to sublease my apartment.  I found someone interested (not someone I know though) and we agreed on rent and everything, but my parents are advising me to ask for a refundable security deposit, the first month of rent, and the last month of rent upfront.  I am just wondering if that type of request is typical.  While I feel like it's smart to ask for something upfront just to make sure that it's serious (and we are planning on signing a contract), that felt excessive to me.  However, it seems like that's actually fairly standard in rentals, and my apartment complex said that I am solely liable if the sub-tenant stops paying rent or causes any damage, so I guess it makes sense for me to take the same precautions that most actual landlords take, right?  I'm assuming I'm not the first person here to sublease, so did you charge (or, for people who were buying the sublease, have to pay) anything upfront?

This is the main place where we are organizing our strategy for Risk! If you don't have discord, we also have a private subreddit for the game - r/GTRisk. This is also a place where you can talk or hear the latest on GT sports.   Just like in college football, **recruiting matters** in this game! The more players we have, the more powerful we are. So you joining the game - yeah, that helps a lot. We are at about 215 Reddit players right now!  \*\*\*\*  **HOW TO PLAY**  The basics: Each school is its own team, but each user on that team gets to make 1 move per turn individually. There is 1 turn per day which takes place as a ""roll"" at 10:30 PM EST. Your turn can consist of choosing to defend any territory current owned by Georgia Tech, or by attacking any territory we currently border. When the ""roll"" happens each night, it is determined which team won each territory and the map is updated. The game is planned to last 45 days, and whichever team has the most territories at the end of that day is the winner!  More info: [Here is a full explanation](https://collegefootballrisk.com/help) of all the rules.  \*\*\*\*\*  **TODAY'S OVERALL UPDATE**  &amp;#x200B;  [Dotted lines show the boundaries for regions.

We still have that 1.5x bonus for everyone on our team, which is huge! With the area being surrounded by other teams, this is no small feat - so great work here!  The Bad: Florida won't die! Them gators are a pesky group, and even though we have them well outnumbered and surrounded, they have managed to eek it out for quite a few consecutive days of near peril. Over the past few turns their chances for survival have been: 76%, 93%, 82%, 96%, and 79%. Some basic stats calculations means their chances of surviving all 5 of those days was about 44%. So we are close. We just need 1 lucky day here. On a related name, we again came within 1 territory of gaining another bonus for the Georgia-Florida Railway region. The lone exception was the loss in Boca Raton - which is where Florida had some of its luck.  [Results in Boca Raton from Turn 23.

t3_1126vxo,College RISK Reddit Game - Day 23 - WE FINALLY GOT A REGION AND ARE SUPERPOWERED!,"Here is the latest on College Football Risk, a 15-seconds a day game of domination and diplomacy between the Division I football universities that is run through Reddit accounts at:  # [collegefootballrisk.com](https://collegefootballrisk.com/)  \*\*\*\*\*  **FIRST SOME IMPORTANT NOTES**  Join the game, your help is needed! You can help Georgia Tech grow and take over North America! Just like in college football, **recruiting matters** in this game! The more players we have, the more powerful we are.  The best way to get in the know on the game once you've joined the team is through the [Georgia Tech Sports Discord (The Hive)](https://discord.gg/urP5V5QyJs) or by joining the subreddit for our team: [r/GTRisk](https://www.reddit.com/r/GTRisk/)  [Here is a full explanation of](https://collegefootballrisk.com/help) the rules, but here are the basics:  Each school is its own team, but each user on that team gets to make 1 move per turn individually. There is 1 turn per day which takes place as a ""roll"" at 10:30 PM EST. Your turn can consist of choosing to defend any territory current owned by Georgia Tech, or by attacking any territory we currently border. When the ""roll"" happens each night, it is determined which team won each territory and the map is updated. The game is planned to last 50 days, and whichever team has the most territories at the end of that day is the winner!  \*\*\*\*\*  **TODAY'S OVERALL UPDATE - GEORGIA TECH PERSPECTIVE**  Wow what a day! We finally had some awesome luck and with that were able to lock down our first region in East Appalachia! This means every single person playing for us will get a 1.5x power multiplier as long as we hold the region. Ok so - some pressure to hold that region, but we are also very close to getting the Georgia-Florida Railway region too. If the dang University of Florida would just die already!  But really this is the best position we've been in in the game thus far. 22 territories is good for 4th place! Keep on keepin' on Jackets!  **A LOOK AT OTHER TEAMS**  Over the past couple days Michigan has climbed back to a near tie with Texas A&amp;M for the lead, with Ohio State in 3rd. Lots of fighting going on right in the middle of the country in that Oklahoma/Kansas area, as well as all along the Canadian border. Texas A&amp;M will be working hard to keep its regions no doubt, while Michigan will be pushing to complete another in Canada.  \*\*\*\*  **ELIMINATED TEAMS YESTERDAY:**  \-None-  (15 teams remain of the 130 that started the game)  \*\*\*\*  **GEORGIA TECH PLAYERS WHO WON A TERRITORY YESTERDAY (the MVPs):**  Bahamas: /u/nalafish  Miami: /u/kharedryl  University Park: /u/BZhu792  Tampa: /u/TheTrueThymeLord  Gainesville: /u/PixelEater  Orlando: /u/pack84reck85  Statesboro: /u/smashiinn  North Atlanta: /u/AspiringLiterature  South Atlanta: /u/Fuller_House  Athens: /u/Sven9888  Birmingham: /u/strongmadstrongsad  Greenville: /u/rwreckengineer  Charlottesville: /u/hdemusg  Morgantown: /u/shitposters_r_us  Huntington: /u/meggersus  College Park: /u/perljam02  Blacksburg: /u/dormdweller99  Lynchburg: /u/JGibel  Norfolk: /u/schmickus  Annapolis: /u/mg7007  Connecticut: /u/JazzlikeCauliflower9  Happy Valley: /u/NittanyLioness21  \*\*\*\*  **MAP UPDATE:**  &amp;#x200B;  [Dotted lines show the boundaries for regions.

According to [https://dining.gatech.edu/terms-%26-conditions](https://dining.gatech.edu/terms-%26-conditions),  &gt;**Beginning with the 2022-2023 academic year, a student’s initial meal plan purchase in the Fall will be selected for the entire academic year (the student is committing to one plan for both Fall and Spring), with the same amount being charged in the fall and spring semesters, respectively.  If a student purchases more than one plan in the Fall, only the first plan will be committed to for the Spring.**    I called GT Dining to clarify and they confirmed that means that whatever plan I bought at the beginning of the semester, I am committed to buying again (so if you bought 100 swipes and used 50 of them, you will be charged for 100 more and begin next semester with 150).  They explained that they need commitment at the beginning of the year so that they can arrange staffing, which is fair enough, only this was not made clear to me or any of my friends.  I am almost certain that the bolded text was added to the terms and conditions *after* most people made their purchases.  Anyway, I wanted to bring this to your attention because so far, I've talked to several people who purchased a meal plan who were not aware of this and had no intention of re-purchasing the same plan.  If you do *not* want to repurchase the same plan you bought at the beginning of the year, you can cancel from December 8th-January 5th for a 75% refund.  If you're in this situation and have no use for the extra swipes/dining dollars that you apparently committed to purchasing, remember to cancel to avoid losing even more of your money.",ForsakenPhase1,1668885790,121,25,gatech,Announcement,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/yzjt5u/psa_if_you_purchased_any_meal_plan_for_fall_2022/

Observe one James Smith, a bright engineering student ready for the big game, only this game will take place in the Twilight Zone.  James: I cannot wait for the game tonight!   Jake: Are you going Andrea? Gonna be lit!  Andrea: I have to stay home and read for my medieval literature class.  James: Yeah! If you were an engineer like us, I would understand. Let’s be real though, literature majors don’t work.  Jake: Boo! Literature sucks! What a joke! You’re not even STEM. You can take a few hours off Andrea. Your homework won’t take all weekend.  Andrea: Well, actually I am going to see a play tomorrow, so I really cannot afford to skip.  Jake: Can you afford not to? Come on Andrea! You’re not going to make any money as a literature student. Meet a husband, so you don’t starve to death. (*Makes kissy faces at Andrea*)  Andrea: I need to pass this class, so I can make money. Come on guys, literature is a respectable major!  James: Literature isn’t a real major. Besides plays are boring. Football is awesome. I’ll make you a deal. If you attend the game, I’ll tutor you for the rest of the semester.

You’re the only boy in this class. Most boys don’t have what it takes to take Advanced Theatre.  James: Theatre? No, this is multivariable calculus. I am an engineering student. I don’t have to take theatre.  Lily: You STEM majors really are stupid! (*all the girls laugh*) All engineering students are required to take at least three semesters of theatre.  Jane: You’d think you’d be happy to learn something useful for once. Of course, you’re probably failing this class anyways. Most engineers just aren’t cut out for theatre classes. It’s not their fault. Their brains only know how to add numbers and have no idea how to write two sentences.  James: Hey! Engineers make plenty of money, and I’m doing just fine in this class.  Lily: Ha! Engineers all end up unemployed. You’ll probably teach shop at a high school.  Andrea: It’s okay James. You’ll be fine. My dad is an engineer. He doesn’t have to make a lot of money because he married a history major.   Jane: LUCKY! They make bank! You girls going to the play this weekend? I heard it’s going to be awesome! You should come James? You could find a wife who will support you!  James: I can’t. I have engineering homework.  Andrea: What do you have to do, add two plus two? You really can’t take the night off? It’s not like you’re liberal arts.  James: Well, I’m going to the football game later.  Jane: Seriously, I didn’t know people even went to those! Football is so boring! James, the whole school will be at the play. We’re pre-gaming it with brunch and mimosas right before!  James: I don’t like mimosas, and I don’t like plays.  Andrea: Typical guy. Can’t take mimosas. Probably doesn’t even understand plays.  James: I understand plays!

We maintain a heterogeneous network  consisting of Windows, Mac OS, and Linux systems.  General computer  experience is necessary and additional experience on Windows, Mac, and  Linux is a plus. Individuals must be enrolled at Georgia Tech but may be  taking a semester without classes.  This job entails user support, diagnosing hardware,  software, and network problems, configuring, installing and maintaining  laptops, workstations, and servers, packaging software, and some AV  support. Generally we do whatever is necessary to keep people up and  running. Some hardware troubleshooting background is of interest, too.   The most important quality is a willingness to learn and a commitment to  building positive client relationships.  The level of commitment would be around 10-20 hours per  week starting at $15/hr. Work times are somewhat flexible (business hours needed, no nights  or weekends) and the individual must be reliable.  Hourly rates are  competitive.  Work environment is relaxed.

I emailed my advisor about this and was basically told, to paraphrase, ""SorryTooBadSoSadGoCry"".   This is.... disheartening. I was really hoping for a GTA position for a number of reasons I won't go in to, but I don't feel so inclined to just completely give up. Has anyone had a similar situation?

We already have the medical supplies provided due to the generosity of MedShare (facilitated by a GR alum!)--now please help us get those supplies and equipment to the people who need them most. **This is a Georgia Tech student, alum, and faculty-led effort**; **please consider contributing or sharing this link**!

t3_y9me8s,the situation surrounding Under the Couch:,"Some of you guys may remember Under the Couch – UTC has been Georgia Tech’s own student-run live music venue and recording studio operated by the Musician’s Network, who currently administrate the practice rooms on the second floor of the new Student Center. UTC was home to the GTMN’s signature weekly open mics, as well as concerts from local and touring bands – at one point even hosting Weezer! In addition to being a place for performances and recording, UTC was an open lounge/study/social space for all students. Originally located in the basement of the Couch building on West Campus, it later relocated to the old student center, at which it remained until the building’s demolition in 2020. The building’s replacement, the recently opened John Lewis Student Center does not provide a home for UTC, and the venue is presently displaced.  From 2020-2022, GTMN was able to operate out of the WREK Radio building near the summit of freshman hill, thanks to WREK’s generosity and support. Open mics and concerts continued, but the recording studio and lounge disappeared. When WREK relocated to the John Lewis Student Center at the start of the 2022-2023 academic year, GTMN became fully displaced. The new Student Center includes two music practice rooms and a currently dysfunctional recording studio, all operated by GTMN, as well as a “Musician’s Lounge”, which consists of a single medium-sized table and some music-themed wallpaper. UTC has, effectively, been killed, and, despite 2+ years of active back-and-forth with admin, no plans currently exist to revive it.  GTMN still hosts open mics and concerts, but from the stranglehold of its lack of a permanent space. What once merely required flipping on some switches, setting up a handful of microphones, and assembling a drum set now requires finding permission to reserve a frequently changing event space for the evening, tearing down a full setup from the larger practice room, rushing across campus with multiple vehicles full to the brim with musical equipment, and feverishly reassembling everything. The whole undertaking is an inconvenience to West Village staff, whose updated building hours have forced GTMN to cut events’ lengths in half and to Student Center janitorial staff, whose cleaning is interrupted by an extended caravan of wagons and carts hauling keyboards, drums, and speakers back to their home in the practice rooms. Despite the challenges, however, GTMN is firmly unwilling to cease its regular activities and events.  Under the Couch was a staple of the Georgia Tech campus; it was the hub of a close-knit, inviting, and inclusive community of people who enjoy all types of music. It was a place of solace from the crushing stress of academia and a source of sanity for countless stressed-out students. It was a place for Tech’s community of composers, producers, singers, instrumentalists, DJs, stand-up comedians, and poets. It was a place for the bands of the local Atlanta music scene to find new fans and for the people of Georgia Tech to find their new favorite artists. Numerous people I’ve spoken to cite UTC as being a significant pull factor that caused them to commit to Georgia Tech over other schools – and were then disappointed to find that it no longer actually exists.  Whether you were around to enjoy Under the Couch or your time on campus began after its demolition, you can help amplify (pun intended) our call to fully re-establish the venue. Georgia Tech’s Comprehensive Campus Plan has released a short online survey to all students and faculty to help inform the creation of a new living document to intended to guide the development of our campus for the next decade. This survey includes a question asking what recreational facilities should be included as part of campus in the future. The linked website also includes a field to directly communicate any suggestions. The survey and suggestion box can be found here: https://campusplan.gatech.edu/  This is absolutely an uphill battle for us, and this change will not happen without support. If you think Georgia Tech should see the return of its student-run music venue, let them know to bring back Under the Couch!",PikmanDude01,1666335258,226,14,gatech,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/y9me8s/the_situation_surrounding_under_the_couch/

I haven't done well in my intro cs classes (should have gotten a C in 1301 but didn't, got Cs in 1331, 1332) but mainly because I barely did any work and crammed information before exams. I like I haven't learned that much and I have no confidence in my coding abilities especially compared to the other cs majors at Tech. (Just to note, I've been struggling w school the past few years and I think I probably would have had the same destructive habits regardless of my major. I recently found out that I am eligible for ODS accomodations so hoping that might help me.)  I feel like I'm wasting money being in school but earning a degree is very important to me.   I feel like my time in college is running out and I'm not getting any smarter.  At this point, Should I just be ok w getting Cs and commit to learning basics and doing leetcode outside of school??  I honestly need any advice. I know it sounds dramatic but I've talked to like every academic/career/counseling coach at Tech and they all kinda dismissed my concerns w ""oh you're on your way to earning a cs degree from Tech"" (well yeah I realize that and I'm thankful, but I also feel like I'm a terrible engineer so does it really matter?) I just don't know what to do in terms of how to get better at coding and whether I should take a break from school.  tl;dr currently fulfilling the ""C's get degrees"" and feeling like I'm not prepared for life after college because I sabotaged my learning.

t3_y879on,Personal opinion on housing/roads/environs near GT,"Like the title says, personal opinion, but a good summary just to put it out there for people who don't get Atlanta  - [On campus](https://housing.gatech.edu/applicants/rates): Freshman year is usually cheaper, least expensive in a quad with communal bathroom is going to be 3320 while apartment style is a few hundred dollars plusminus 5000. So mid August to September, Sep to Oct, Oct to Nov, Nov to Dec is about 4 months so your cost is about $1200 for something like NAVE per month.  **Pros/Cons**: Good location, could get better for price  Personally something I really dislike about Atlanta is the commute; if you're used to living in denser cities with good transport, then what would be 20 minutes by bike or tram is 20 hellish minutes on I75/85. So for me personally getting something cheaper and far away is not a good option for my lifestyle, but it is out there.  One other big problem with off campus housing at GT is that it's cut across by 4 huge roads at all sides, namely North Avenue, I75/85, 10th street, and Northside Dr. In my opinion this makes a commute from off campus to GT extremely annoying/dangerous considering how people drive in Atlanta. These streets are okay to cross at certain intersections or bridges.  - I would personally avoid the North Avenue Bridge (underdeveloped, shooting at the BP gas station).  - North Avenue/Techwood is an okay intersection just because of the amount of students. - Many parts of 10th street are underdeveloped but the 10th St/Hemphill and 10th St/Atlantic Drive intersections are good.  - There's a sky bridge across North Avenue near Inspire through a parking lot, but I rarely see anyone use it. - Midtown through 5th street bridge is great. - Northside Dr./10th St is pretty underdeveloped but a lot of people do go through there.  Anecdotal thoughts on housing:  - The Mark, UHouse: buildings in midtown are too tall so you wait forever at the elevator + midtown tends to be loud from cars revving, misc. stuff that happens. Not super impressed by the construction there.   - I've heard Modera is the best but the most expensive, never been inside.  - I like the apartments around Atlantic Station (for me it's peaceful and not too tall) but some would consider it too far.  - Inspire seems to have a good combination of location + facilities, but $$$, some of the West Midtown apartments are okay too  - Heard decent things about SQ5, not sure about The Standard  - Home Park is hit or miss, there are some good spots and some bad spots, prices are okay, drive around and look at phone numbers",self-promotion-melon,1666196968,11,4,gatech,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/y879on/personal_opinion_on_housingroadsenvirons_near_gt/

t3_y862dv,Georgia Tech is not your adversary. Stop treating it this way.,"If I had a dollar for every time someone on this sub launched into a ridiculous rant about Georgia Tech, I could afford to purchase the Braves. *So many* posts and comments could be summed up below:  ""**GEORGIA TECH HAS A SHITTY REGISTRATION/PARKING/HOUSING/OTHER SYSTEM. WHY WON'T SOME LAZY SORRY ASS STAFF MEMBER MOVE HEAVEN AND HELL TO DO SOMETHING THAT I PROBABLY CAN'T DO ANYWAY?? THE FACULTY AND STAFF HERE ARE EVIL VILLAINS WHO LOVE TO SEE US SUFFER. WHY DOESN'T THIS SCHOOL** ***CARE*** **ABOUT STUDENTS?""**  **STOP IT.** This mindset is *toxic*. It *doesn't* improve anything. It *doesn't* shed light on *why* certain processes that inconvenience us are the way they are and it *doesn't* detail how we as students can work to change things that need to be changed. Sure, there's nothing wrong with ranting and blowing off steam (and there is such a thing as ""good ranting""), but so many complaints on here are a result of misplaced expectations, a student not understanding a policy and getting mad about it, or something that's common at colleges in general. Many rants are easily debunked or fall apart when you consider the broader context of the situation.  **- The student body needs to understand** the roles that various Tech employees play in our experience and what their job entails and what it does not entail. **Example**: Academic advisors. Every semester we get a ton of rants about how they're ""useless"" because they didn't do some random task that they either don't have the power to do or cannot do because of a policy. [They're not useless](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/wwm6ft/comment/ilmhjuv/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \- **Faculty, staff, and administration WANT to see us succeed**. That *doesn't* mean they'll bend over backwards to do a specific thing that you want, though some might. It means you *will* need to work within the proper channels and media to get what you need. **Example:** You'll need to talk to your professor *ahead of time* if you're in a poor mental space and you need an extension on something. It does NOT mean never saying a word about it and when your professor doesn't accept your request for an extension in the 11th hour, come to /r/gatech to complain about how that professor ""doesn't care about mental health"". The common notion that ""Georgia Tech doesn't care about students"" is *bunk*.  \- **Faculty, staff, and administration are human too.** Don't treat them like an obstacle that you have to ""deal"" with (see the fourth bullet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/a3j5i6/comment/eb7l46r/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). ***And*** ***can we STOP calling attention to people's salary*** and questioning whether or not the employee does enough to earn it? Are *you* going to be the kind of manager who docks someone's pay because they didn't do something right that one time? That's an awful practice. Treat faculty, staff, and administration the way you want to be treated.  Just because someone completed something 8 seconds slower than you wanted, does not make them ""lazy"". You don't know what's on their plate, inside and outside of work. Staffers are NOT robots who accept tasks and spit out results on the hour. We as a student body need to understand that they are *human beings* with their own tasks, goals, and challenges and their world does not revolve around us.  \- **Instead of endless ranting about everything**, why can't students on /r/gatech propose *positive, constructive,* and *realistic* solutions to problems on campus? I see people listing problems but nobody is listing *realistic* *actionable* solutions while I see a lot of pipe-dreamy shit get upvoted.  The Student Center renovation was the culmination of a long process that started because *students* [made a big deal](https://nique.net/opinions/2010/08/26/consensus-growing-pains/) about it. It didn't happen because Bud Peterson woke up one day and said ""The students *really* want a white elephant that helps nobody!! I don't give a fuck about their mental health"". It happened because students brought a need to the administration who then initiated a [planning and visioning process](https://studentcenter.gatech.edu/campus-center/anticipated-timeline) that took years, and if you've been inside it you would see it's anything *but* a ""white elephant"".  **Example**: People complain about space in the CRC, but has anybody worked out the nitty gritty details of what an expansion would involve? [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/s0j1g2/comment/hs39s0d/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) is the rough solution that I came up with. Moving to self-op dining was something SGA kickstarted even though the culmination of that took 2.5 years. If we want to see a CRC expansion, it starts with SGA and it **WILL** **NOT** be an easy-peasy done-in-a-semester process if we want a result the student body will be happy with.  \- **Instead of framing our interactions with various services** in terms of some nameless faceless corporation that we have to go to war with to get anything done, why not frame them in terms of interactions with fellow human beings? Think Tech Dining serves the devil’s turds in the dining halls? Have you given them your feedback? This video certainly leads me to believe that the people who run Tech Dining are not the greedy sadistic bastards that /r/gatech would lead you to think and they actually care about our input.   \- **I post the things that I do to provide a different perspective that students rarely consider**. It takes a lot to run a university and the services within. There are a lot of factors that go into aspects of campus life that students don’t consider when ranting on here. Believe it or not, the viewpoint of students on /r/gatech is not the only one considered when decisions are made. There are also a lot of people on here who like to play Armchair Administrator and act as if they know better than people in charge. That is not to say a student will never know better, just that it *reeks* of arrogance. **Example**: ""REGISTRATION AND WIFI ARE TERRIBLE HERE. STUDENTS CAN DO BETTER THAN OIT"". [It's not that simple](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/8ijgc8/comment/dysawwd/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

You *think* they’re playing checkers but the game is more complicated than that.  \- **I implore all of you to consider the deeper and wider reaching reasons that things are the way they are**. Reasons beyond the common refrains on this sub like ""GEORGIA TECH JUST DOESN'T CARE ABOUT STUDENTS THEY ONLY WANT OUR MONEY BLAH BLAH BLAH...."". If you put yourself in another person's shoes, you may realize that things are not as they seem, and there are indeed factors that fall outside of GT's control. Pointing this stuff out doesn’t make me a shill, a contrarian, a “soldier for the establishment”, or one of the other ridiculous labels I’ve been given on here.  If anybody thinks that I am wrong about something I’m saying on here, feel free to point out the flaw in my logic. Like faculty, staff, and admin, I am only human and I am capable of admitting when I’m wrong about something.  &amp;#x200B;  **TL;DR** \- Be positive. Stop assuming the worst in people. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Understand the broader context around circumstances before ranting about an inconvenience and try to see things from the perspective of another person.

t3_y860yz,FYI about Inspire Atlanta Lease Structure,"They designate two weeks for cleaning in August so you effectively pay `total lease amount` / `11.5` but they charge you per month. So if your rent is `1000`, it's actually `1043.478` per month, or essentially a 4.3478% or so increase above the stated price.  Some other misc. tidbits:  - The cheaper parking spot (tandem parking) just means one car blocks the other from exiting  - Mandatory renter's insurance (this is something nice to get on your own time anyways, covers your own stolen items but you should itemize them beforehand)  - Application of $350 (200 admin fee aka cleaning fee for those two weeks is how they justified it, 100 deposit, 50 application fee)  - Balcony is more expensive",self-promotion-melon,1666194047,23,3,gatech,Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/y860yz/fyi_about_inspire_atlanta_lease_structure/

I still didn't think we'd be any better, but at least he was gone. *But then we beat a ranked team*. ***And then we won two games in a row, which we haven't done since before I was a student (2018).***  This is the most hope I've felt in years.

t3_xkctuv,Thoughts on Career Hunting Season,"As career fairs are going on and we're in the peak of fall recruiting season, I wanted to just pass along some random thoughts having been through all of this for a few years now.   First and foremost, **an internship/fulltime offer does not define you**! As someone who struggled with a long time to actually find a co-op, I battled with alot of thoughts of self-doubt about my abilities and who I was. I think I had applied to over 240 positions before finally landing a job with dozens of rejected interviews along the way. I felt drained and immensely like I didn't belong here; I was surrounded by friends getting Big Tech internships, great offers from top consulting firms, while I was stuck with dozens of rejection emails or being ghosted. Just know if you're in the same boat, you're not alone but most importantly, it does not define who you are. You're a freaking Georgia Tech student, having that name alone of your resume gives you a one-up over so many candidates. You're at one of the top institutions in the ~~country~~ world and there are tons of companies who would jump at the chance to hire you. Yeah maybe your classmate got a Big Tech job, yeah maybe the kid down the hall accepted an MBB internship, but who cares; you are still immensely successful to even just be here, and never let the job hunt deter you from the amazing worth you have.  Second, sometimes you gotta take the jobs that are stepping stones to get somewhere you really want to be. I started with two co-op rotations at an HVAC company and thought I was gonna be stuck there, never being able to get any other work opportunities. But even having that experience opened other doors, I got a job in a big retail company and eventually got to hop to a tech firm and was loving it. Not everyone has the opportunity to jump immediately into those highly coveted companies, sometimes it takes the little stepping stones of experience to get there. If you only held out for Apple or McKinsey or Google or NASA, you might be waiting a while. Sometimes you have to take the offer you may have or give the smaller company a shot, sometimes you'll even learn more valuable skills at those places instead of mega-companies. See what you enjoy and what you don't, get that experience, and if you wanna hop to a better opportunity then now you have real-world experience. Nothing wrong with working your way up the ladder; Rome wasn't built in a day and an Apple internship wasn't gotten first shot either.  Lastly, never be afraid to reach out to others, especially when it comes to career building. Tech is full of tons of brilliant and successful people, many of whom would love to help you with career advice, networking, resume building, you name it. I know when I was going through the job hunt I only started at it alone, never asking advice or recommendations, never asking for friends to review my resume or practice interviewing, and doing things alone definitely builds to the stress. You'll never know what you may find from reaching out to a friend to review your resume, they may have tweaks that can be made that you overlook. Also, networking! Making friends is always great, especially friends in classes. That person sitting a few seats down may be both a great friend and a valuable professional connection one day. Disclaimer please don't make new friends with the sole purpose of career networking, that's not the best practice lol.  Anyway, that's your daily dose of random career knowledge from your friendly 5th year. Best of luck to everyone who's looking for employment, y'all got this!!  **tl:dr - Job offers or lack thereof don't define who you are, it's okay to use have stepping stones to build up to what you love, never go at this career hunt alone**",bigdaddymemester,1663784898,28,3,gatech,Other,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/xkctuv/thoughts_on_career_hunting_season/

t3_xjcax9,Professional Tip: Learn to Use a Laptop,"I'm a Tech grad (2015).  I started at my current company as a co-op, and have been with them long enough to see shifts in the populations of the 15-20 co-ops per semester at the company.  In recent years, as co-ops have moved from late Millennials to Gen Z, I have noticed a huge shift in the comfort level of college-aged kids using laptops. That is to say, they aren't comfortable with them at all.   At first, I thought it was isolated. I had a co-op that did everything on their phone. When you asked for, say, an excel spreadsheet to be updated, they were completely out of their comfort zone, even going so far as to get Excel on their phone to complete the task.   Then it kept happening.  Now, these people aren't all from Georgia Tech, and honestly the Tech folks are better about this. But my strong advice to the next generation is: make sure you are comfortable using a laptop, with a Windows OS. The vast majority of business is conducted on a Windows OS. I don't care if your uncle's entire business is on Mac, this is not the norm.  And by all that is holy, if you do get Outlook on your phone for your job, remove the ""Get Outlook for iOS/Android"" default signature. It's exceedingly tacky, for one, and if you are supposed to be at your desk when you send something clearly from your phone, someone is going to interpret it as you are slacking off.   Phones are fantastic tools. I am writing this from a phone right now. They can be utilized in industry to a great extent.

I understand they are completely within their rights to do this, but for some reason I still feel rubbed the wrong way about the whole situation, given that I almost get hit by drivers or have to swerve around drivers (and busses!) stopped in the bike lane nearly every day and almost never see any rules around invasion of the bike lanes or reckless behavior by drivers enforced.  I think cyclists should be allowed to yield at stop signs, as it speeds up traffic for everyone without significantly increasing risk. Unfortunate to see GT repeating the [same mistakes](https://road.cc/content/news/160118-san-francisco-cyclists-protest-obeying-traffic-rules) that San Francisco make 7 years ago, especially in a city that so desperately needs to to take a different approach to urban planning and development that does not rely on car infrastructure.

t3_xhpn58,"Going to fail a class, what to do?","I'm currently taking a class that counts towards an accounting degree as an accounting elective but is essentially requiring me to use Python to run simulations and analyze data frames.    None of the pre-req classes used Python and are all MGT courses (including ACCT I), I asked the professor for help on an assignment, but he couldn't answer me directly since he didn't want to ""give me the answer,"" even though I told him I never used Python before and have never coded outside of CS 1315.   We use DataCamp, which covers some topics necessary for the assignments, but it is so simplistic that their explanation of codes and functions is practically unapplicable outside their example scenarios for someone as dumb as me.    In-class, the professor basically just goes off and does high-level coding that only the CS students in my class seem to all understand. The functions and skills shown in-class aren't even related to the code we need to create to complete the assignments so I can't even hope to dissect in-class code to salvage something for the assignment.    We're going to have exams on recognizing and addressing coding errors in Python but I'm not even sure how I'm supposed to prepare for a test like that since that is something that sounds like is gained from using Python over a period of time and running into errors in your own code. I probably won't know that there is an error until I try to run it.   I can get the gist of what the assignment(s) want me to code but I get to points where I don't even know how to articulate my question in ""coding terms,"" because I only started using Python 2 weeks ago.

t3_wv4pyo,Parking permit help? I’m a commuter student,"I’m graduating this December but I recently moved further away from campus. I have a car and can drive down to my classes MWF but I also have transportation through my partner who loves driving and is willing to drop me off and pick me up three days a week. I’m trying to decide if it’s more time and money efficient to be dropped off or if I should drive myself and if I drive what kind of parking permit should I get?   I’m going to list the pros and cons of each so y’all get the picture and for my own benefit.   Being dropped off-  Pros: - don’t have to drive - no parking permit - time spent with my partner - can stay overnight with friends  Cons: - have to be dropped off like an elementary kid - twice as many trips since my partner has to drive home (gas money here too) - have to work around their schedule (likely means staying late and arriving early to avoid traffic) - probably will end up driving myself to campus at least a couple times when the timing just doesn’t work (spending money on visitor parking anyway) - bad for the environment   Driving myself-  Pros: - arrive whenever I want - fewer trips - no one to tell me I shouldn’t buy dunkin (this is probably a con tbh) - smart park permit pay as you go  Cons: - I don’t like driving - parking permit?? - can’t stay overnight if I get the Smart park permit - I will probably stay overnight anyway and have to pay visitor rates  Thank you to anyone who made it through all of that and any advice would be much appreciated.

t3_wubiw6,The Russian language is critical: The case for GT Russian,"Hi everyone! GT Russian has seen a major decrease in the number of students interested in taking beginner Russian language courses since the start of Russia's total war in Ukraine. However, partially for that reason, there is a huge need for Russian-language skills--**and a major government recruiting push for them**.  As a student in the program, I cannot tell you how anti-war everyone I have spoken with at GT is. I also can't praise GT Russian language courses to you enough. Experiences with the language and the people from Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Belarus, Atlanta Russian community, and beyond that I have met as a result have changed my life and career goals permanently. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.  The case for Russian at GT:  I **completely recommend GT Russian classes,** even to **absolute beginners.** I found myself connected to a whole other part of the world, met super interesting people and made close friends, and developed a unique skill that really differentiates me (*especially* as an AE, CS, or INTA major, this will be the case for you). Also!  1. The **classes are small** and I am on a first-name basis with all of my professors (who have written me stellar recs for major scholarships). 2. The **funding** through GT and the government is *immense* (get a whole semester or a year abroad paid for including flight, whole semester of tuition, and then some kind of immense). 3. The GT Russian **community** (and GT Russian club) are super diverse, active, and connected even this semester. So it's a great way to make friends, go to fun events, try new free foods, and find a support network! We communicate via Discord :) [https://discord.gg/ZgvyDemvUw](https://discord.gg/ZgvyDemvUw) 4. **Study abroad** programs are still available, almost built into the curriculum, and take you to amazing, beautiful **safe** places, outside of Russia. 5. I was **virtually guaranteed an A** if I showed up and tried even a little.  **If you have any questions at all, or even just want to chat, you can reach me here or via our Discord :D**  We have two sections of first-semester Russian this semester:  MW 2:00-3:15, F 2:00-2:50  MW 11:00-12:15, F 11:00-11:50  For registration questions and more, you can also reach Dr. Marina Yancey, [myancey30@gatech.edu](mailto:myancey30@gatech.edu)",Legitimate_Ad_6584,1661119076,126,19,gatech,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/wubiw6/the_russian_language_is_critical_the_case_for_gt/

Systems and Architecture sounds fun because I've always wanted to know why computers work. And after doing a bit of searching, a lot of people say it's probably the best thread in terms of knowledge.  Theory might be nice to do because I remember a friend telling me that if you don't know why something works, it doesn't matter how much you know about current frameworks and whatnot, it'll all be outdated in 15 years, while the theory behind said frameworks will never get old. That said, I don't know how necessary or practical it is to learn the theory behind CS when I could be learning something else instead.  Intelligence seems like a good choice since I like the math and it'll easily be a practical skill.  Modeling and Simulation seems fun because if I wasn't doing CS, I'd want to do mechanical engineering. And another semester of physics or chem is always welcome. That said, I have a hunch that modeling and simulation does have great synergy with other threads.  Tl;dr I'm not sure which threads I should pick. Ultimately, I think I could end up enjoying any of  them, but I also want to pick up some skills that will be useful to me later (the reason I picked CS over ME is because of a little horror story I heard from a friend about a GT mechanical engineering major who graduated, was unemployed for two years, and didn't get a job until after he went back and got a grad degree. I'd like to avoid having my own horror stories to share about finding work after graduating).

It is my mission to make this club multi-collegiate. That is, I don't want the club to just stop at UF! Recently UCF was added to the list of Universities with a branch of The Society of PC Building. Let’s not stop here though, I want Georgia Tech to join too! My plan is to start mainly with larger public colleges in the United States, but then slowly branch out to make this organization international. I then want to create a league of Universities to have official pc building competitions!  So, if you're interested in running an official club for building computers, please feel free to message me or comment here and we can talk!

I wasn't able to find anyone livin' there. I'd really appreciate it y'all can help us out with some advice and reviews for Camden.  Also, the minimum lease period is 15 months at Camden, so if we face any issue we won't be able to break the lease, I guess.  P. S. : Only one floor plan is left at the Camden Apartments.

If your apartment complex has a pool, or you're willing to travel, let me know.  I'm a recent Master's Alum and was hoping to take some swim lessons this summer. Unfortunately, the CRC is completely booked and has no availability until months from now.  I'm in a weird spot with my skills. I can: 1.) Backstroke pretty much forever  I can't: 1.) Front crawl 2.) Treadwater 3.) Float on my back without some minor stroke  I'm not afraid of water/being submerged. My main goal is to be able to front crawl laps, and way down the line participate in a sprint triathlon.  I live near campus and am flexible with my availability as well as lesson lengths (30/45/60 minutes) Pay can also be discussed based on experience/availability, but I'm thinking between $45-60/hr  Feel free to drop a response or send me a pm!",Abstractvector,1653068954,15,6,gatech,Job Listing,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/uu3mog/seeking_swim_lessons_this_summer/

This includes the green fee, a gift bag with East lake merch, breakfast, and a post round reception. $1,000 seems extremely ridiculous for what you're getting here. Now i realize I'm definitely not the right demographic for this event as a broke grad student still at GT, but even if I was a young professional with an engineering salary I wouldn't pay that.

Every time a professor of mine announces that final replacement is an option, all of my classmates get excited and say things to the effect of ""midterm 2 doesn't matter because my final will replace it.""  I personally don't see it as beneficial because finals are usually harder than midterms for me. I tend to score the same or much lower on my finals compared to my midterms. I have to study for 4-5 of them at a time and they cover the whole semester of content, and for classes where the content isn't all super connected, it can be very difficult to study for. Is there something I'm missing? Am I an outlier in finding finals worse than midterms?

t3_tna07t,GTAA SCANDAL: STOLEN WAFFLE RECIPE?? HOW DEEP DOES IT GO??,"The Alumni Association sent out an email today with the headline ""Don't Waffle! Get your GT butter pat now!"".  I have 2 grievances with this email. The first is that I clicked on it hoping for a way to acquire GT butter pats, but it turns out that wasn't what it meant. Fine. The second is with the [waffle recipe card](https://www.gtalumni.org/s/1481/alumni/17/magazine-pages.aspx?sid=1481&amp;gid=21&amp;pgid=19727) that the email linked to.  I thought at first that maybe this recipe was submitted by a tech alumnus, who perhaps inherited the waffle secrets from their grandparents, who first used the recipe in question to make illegal waffles behind Cloudman Hall during the great waffle ban of 1936.  Not so.  A quick google search resulting in the following recipe (sensitive readers be warned): [Light and Crispy Waffles](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/25708/essential-waffle-recipe/itr_print/) on InspiredTaste.net  The ingredient list and directions are practically identical, with only the following notable differences:  * 2 tsp vanilla extract vs 1 tsp * Tech recipe doesn't mention ""Butter, syrup, and/or berries, for serving"" * Gatech keeps the size of whisking bowl a secret * Second half of the instructions are significantly reworded (but still practically identical in contents), first half is almost word for word  There doesn't seem to be any connection between the website's authors and Tech (though this assumption is based solely on their [about us page](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/aboutus/) mentioning places they've lived and not including Georgia).  The recipe is adapted from a [Food Network Recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/waffle-of-insane-greatness-recipe-1943589), which is in turn from a restaurant in Chattanooga. I thought someone in Chattanooga might be more likely to have relations with Tech, but the Tech recipe doesn't bear nearly the same resemblance to these other recipes that it does to the InspiredTaste.net version.  I'm worried that this may be part of a greater waffle conspiracy, any reassurance appreciated.   EDIT: As u/OneEightActual noted, the formulation of recipes is non-copyrightable, but the wording of the instructions is. I think that the blalant almost-copying is at worst copyright infringement and at best not a great look for tech, given that they didn't cite their source for the recipe (at time of posting).  I think a reasonable set of demands for the alumni association are to EITHER dissolve the alumni association, Georgia Tech, and the University System of Georgia OR update the recipe card to cite their source (MLA or IEEE citation preferred, Chicago style can go cite itself).",literallyanonion,1648168987,183,16,gatech,Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/tna07t/gtaa_scandal_stolen_waffle_recipe_how_deep_does/

The purpose is to provide a good excuse to talk with new people and make friends, since it's hard to talk to strangers offline without a compelling reason nowadays. It happens maybe up to several times a week and around the noon. No fee or registration is needed. We can put up a sign during the meetup, so that those who haven't heard of this can also join. Let me know your feedback.  # Rationale  I've seen many people here lamenting their lack of opportunities to meet new people. Even though Clough building is full of students all the time, iiuc most of them usually talk with their friends only and don't really have a good excuse to talk with others. I feel it's getting harder and harder to talk to new people offline.  Clubs, frats, classes, and dorms are good opportunities for meeting new people, but they have some limitations. For example, clubs and classes tend to unintentionally segregate people because people with different backgrounds (e.g. gender, race) are likely to be interested in different activities. Not everyone lives in a dorm or wants to join a frat. All of these opportunities set some barrier to entry and unnecessarily complicate the task of meeting new people imo.",HigherTopoi,1645650548,22,7,gatech,Social,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/szs26w/unofficial_meetups_on_campus_for_people_to/

Also, this includes the open water (OW) portion of the class which is usually handled with your GT instructor planning a long weekend trip to Key Largo. Unfortunately, this trip can be expensive. Key Largo is nice, but if you want to finish up the OW without the expense of going to the keys you can do it north of Atlanta at Kraken Springs in a subsequent weekend (we have one scheduled for the weekend of 4/23).

t3_syx8o4,There has been a rat in our NAVE apartment and GT Housing did NOTHING for 40+ hours.,"UPDATE: After more than 48 hours and this reddit post, GT sent in pest control to deal with the problem—we appreciate your kind words  We have had a ***RAT*** in our kitchen for almost 2 days now. On Sunday night, for several hours, we had been hearing odd noises in the kitchen, which we thought were ventilation hitting plastic bags or the neighbors or something else. When we finally investigated, we saw… *it*.  We immediately called the RA on duty who offered us some rat traps and told us we would be unable to call building services until the morning. The loud noises of scratching and thrashing left us with only a few hours of sleep until we went to the North Ave Housing Office at around 9am on Monday morning, who immediately called emergency services to send someone.  By 11am, no one had come, so we visited the housing office again, and a second call to emergency services told us that they were dealing with other issues but would “definitely be there later” (their words) the same day. Multiple roommates stayed in the apartment all day, waiting for someone to arrive, but no one ever did. We also called the housing office in the evening, and were told to wait until the next morning. This was Monday—we all had classes, clubs, and even an exam. We had plans made throughout the day that we were forced to cancel because of the unfortunate twist of fate that had brought this demon spawn into our home.  Throughout the day and night, we managed to get peanut butter and cheese and set out so many traps that we’ve become worried about stepping on them ourselves. This morning, we checked the traps to find the only change was one trap missing both its bait and a caught rat. This led us to again visit the housing office, who called the work center, and received an unsatisfactory response with not even an assurance that anyone would come today, until a later email said pest control would arrive (which has still not happened as of posting this).   In this email, we were informed that pest control contractors apparently do not come to campus on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but this should not have even been an issue, as we informed them ***MONDAY AT 9AM*** about this problem.   The rat has been in our kitchen for 40+ hours now, with no assistance from anyone at housing. One of our roommates **does not have a meal plan**, and cooks using ingredients and appliances which he now **cannot access** due to the rodent. He literally cannot eat his normal food. There is also what appears to be a *hole nibbled in the base of our fridge*, and despite multiple traps set around the kitchen, the rat is still making noise and has not been caught, *which should not even be our responsibility.*   This rat has been crawling around near our kitchen ingredients, and we have no clue ***what*** ***diseases*** it may have and may be spreading not just to us but to our food. There may also be *more rats*, which is of concern to our neighbors and the building as a whole. For a Nave East that claims to create a “NAEighborhood”, I certainly don’t feel like a neighbor.   We have been filming and documenting the rat throughout this time to ensure we have proof and know where it is at any time.   Frankly, this is **completely** unacceptable. The fact that the problem was not addressed *immediately* is ridiculous. I would like to remind you that we pay $1200/month **per tenant** ($4800/month for the unit) and this is the quality of the housing. These are not the conditions any of us expected signing up for living in North Ave, and the fact that the school has been completely unable to deal with the issue and left us on our own makes it clear how little value this university places on students.   I can hear Melvin (that’s what we named the damn thing) scratching around as I type this. I can hear Melvin when I go to the bathroom, when I take a test, and when I sit and watch TV.   ***Upperclassmen should not live in Nave***— these conditions are not just unacceptable but *insulting* for a university that seems to have such high aspirations and is world-renowned for the quality of its education. However, this “quality” means absolutely nothing if student health cannot be taken care of, whether mentally or physically. While we manage ourselves and our own problems, the fact that we could not do anything about this problem due to a total failure to respond from GT Housing blows a hole in the reputation this institution, which holds itself so highly on a national and global level, claims to have.   Every high school friend and relative who we’ve told about this has lost interest in attending Georgia Tech if this is the kind of care the school gives to its students. We’re not angry that there was a rat — these things happen — but for the school to require 48 hours, multiple calls, in-person visits, and assertion from our part (due to the anger of having a ***RAT in our kitchen*****)** to do literally ANYTHING is just a symptom of Georgia Tech’s complete inability to provide and care for its students. I would like to remind you that as of posting this, after 40+ hours and a good dozen visits, calls, and emails, the only concrete thing we have is an email that pest control will arrive “sometime today.” It is 3PM and I am beginning to doubt even this, but I will keep you updated.",WorseThanSilver,1645561152,249,55,gatech,Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/syx8o4/there_has_been_a_rat_in_our_nave_apartment_and_gt/
t3_syx40g,Advice and Etiquette for CRC Pools,"Hello all! I used to swim a lot, and want to get back into it, but first wanted to ask a couple things about what it's like swimming at the CRC.   So first, as I understand it, there are two pools for students, the competitive pool and leisure pool lap lanes, and I can find their respective hours online. Besides their hours, what's the difference between the two pools? Are they different lengths, and/or are they meant for different purposes?   Second, I know there's no 'sign up' for lanes. So, is the etiquette to just share with whoever's there currently and/or split the lanes? I'm a rather slow swimmer, and the last thing I want to do is get in the way of other people there.   And finally, how busy are the lanes normally, and what are some of the least busy times to go? I guess this can somewhat mitigate my previous question if I just happen to go when not a lot of other people are there.

t3_syrb3y,Trouble picking a major. ME vs CompE,"Hi! I am a transfer pathway program hopeful that is needing advice for picking a major. According to what I have heard pathway programs do not allow students to switch majors once they have applied. This makes it very difficult to choose a specific major, especially, since I do not know exactly what I would want to do in the future.   At my current institution, I am an undeclared engineering major that has been taking some CS courses as well. I have explored various different fields of study but most notably I have experienced a lot of electrical engineering work. I also have a huge passion for mathematics and ML/AI.  Currently I am thinking about applying to either Computer Engineering or Mechanical Engineering. These are the two majors that encompass most of my skills and interests. If I were to stay at my current university I would for sure major in Computer Engineering and Science but what I have been hearing about the CompE curriculum and department has made me hesitant to pursue it at GT.

t3_s8bg7d,"How do I interpret ""PhD Cohort Time to Degree?""","I'm specifically looking at the Doctoral Program Statistics from lite.gatech.edu if there are those who wanted to follow along visually.  I filter the Major by HCC. For 2013-14: 77 applications, 22 offers, 11 admitted. Makes sense so far. So I scroll down to the bottom. I'm trying to figure out what happened to these 11 people for cohort of 2013-14 who accepted, so I look at the 2013-2014 section under PhD Cohort Time to Degree.  28.6% graduated on the 5th year. What does this mean? 11 * .286? 3.1 people from that cohort graduated and someone's arm graduated?  Or maybe its the total students from that year? So I scrolled up to see the demographics graph, and it shows 38 people enrolled for 2013-14. 38 * .286 = 10.8? So 11 people graduated and then someone sacrificed their leg to Buzz to pay off library fees?  The data seems cumulative, but then it sometimes doesn't. In 2014-2015 I think it means 40% of that cohort graduated and then in 6 years 80% of that cohort graduated? The admissions say 10 people accepted that year, so 4 individuals graduated in 5 years, 4, graduated in 6 and 2 dropped out?  In 2012-2013 we see 25% at 6 years and going forward: does that mean only 25% of that cohort graduated, and then another 25%? But it totals up to 125% from 6 to 10 years, so that doesn't make any sense.

That assignment had a comment on it by the professor saying ""Great work."" There were actually two incorrect scores, but I never saw the correct score for the second assignment which always showed as a 0 (it was to answer a number of questions, and I'm sure that not every answer was wrong). On our second correspondence, the professor said she was having technical difficulties that was making grades show as a 0 in canvas, and said it would be fixed for final grades.  The grade only showed in OSCAR just now, being NR for the longest time because she apparently had difficulty uploading them there too, but now it shows as the letter grade as if those assignments were still 0. There are no curves, exams, or assignments not yet graded, grading is very straightforwards with labs 60% and Perusall 40% using total point system for both. The only possibility for it to drop as far as the lower letter grade is if BOTH assignments were still incorrectly a score of 0, even though her first correspondance confirmed that at least the first one was not a 0.  I can't help but feel both mad and screwed over by this, should I just accept a lower grade because of a grading mistake even though I did the work and legitimately scored the higher grade?

t3_rl6h6e,Georgia Tech Themed Car Design,I’ve recently bought a 1993 Ford festiva  and am thinking about turning it into a Tech themed car. If I were to do this I’d start with the base layer being painted tech gold but I want to add other designs on top. If y’all got any suggestions I’d love to hear them. Some ideas I’ve thought about are race car style designs on the sides such as GT and maybe buzz on the hood.,ConsciousOpinion2563,1640062073,7,4,gatech,Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/rl6h6e/georgia_tech_themed_car_design/

t3_rjh8t4,congrats - you got out! now find your financial footing...,"Congrats to those who walked this weekend.  The hard part is over (for the most part :)  You're a GT grad, and with that, hopefully comes the financial payday in the form of a rock-solid job offer with great pay and great benefits. For those who didn't learn the basics growing up, just a few pointers to get you started the right way...  In no particular order...  * Emergency fund.  Once you have a groove going and know what your typical monthly expenses are, build an emergency fund that will cover at least between 3-6 months of those expenses.  This should be in a safe savings vehicle (NOT the stock market) that you build then forget about.  Ok to do it gradually, over 12-24 months, but having an emergency fund is non-negotiable. * Check your credit report ([annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com) is the government site), get your scores, and take care to never miss a payment on any loan you take out.  Your goal is to get to a FICO score of 720 or higher. * As soon as you can, get enrolled in your company's 401k (or 403b) plan.  Be sure to contribute enough to get all the company matching dollars - never leave free money on the table. * Between your 401k plan and/or an IRA, aim to save at least 15% of your gross salary (not take-home pay) each year by the time you reach your mid- to late- 20s.  If you can't do 15% immediately, gradually work up to it by increasing your savings by 1-2% each year.  \[Won't get into the specifics of pre-tax or after-tax (Roth), but the latter allows you to set aside money after taxes are paid, which means your money grows tax-free, so when you take it out at retirement, no taxes due.\]  Finally, enjoy yourself too!  No need to sacrifice everything for a future that is never promised.  But these early years of saving a little bit of your hard-earned money will benefit you nicely in 40 years when you're looking to retire, not to mention minimizing money stressors over the coming few decades.  \#you\_DID\_that  \#go\_kick\_some\_a$$  Best of luck Jackets!",rainking99,1639863442,253,14,gatech,Other,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/rjh8t4/congrats_you_got_out_now_find_your_financial/
