      "Negative post: Title: PTS has loved ticketing and towing me this week... | Selftext: ER51 lot has been under construction the entire year so far. There are practically no spots left for this parking permit as a result. When I purchased my permit there was NO warning and NO care to allow us to switch to other lots--and now I have been paying the price the whole year. They seem very overzealous to ticket and tow me over accidentally parking in \"RSER51\" which I thought indicated it was ONLY for ER51 patrons. Apparently this code means it's a reserved spot--so my $800 that I worked for to pay for my spot means nothing even with the code for ER51. Poor signage and  low effort to contact the owners of these vehicles is costing us. Not only that but I have had at least 18 days where I cannot park in my lot due to games or other events. I am extremely frustrated; I use my car to get to work, I don't just have it on campus for shits and giggles. I really wish there was more done about this. | Flair: Rant\n",

      "Negative post: Title: GT needs to drop their contracts with BEST/GardaWorld security.  | Selftext: BEST has been an overall plague on so many GT events over the past few years. With the recent discussion on athletics troubles and career fair issues, I just wanted to publish my thoughts on things I’ve seen happen.  Every year we play at home for the uGA football game, the student section gets flooded and BEST “rent a cops” have always been belligerent to students, blocking them from their seats.  Last year during the UNC football game, students stormed the field. The entire stadium atmosphere changed 1-2 minutes before the end of the game, and it was obvious it was coming. BEST security body checked and tackled the first few field stormers, despite 1000s more behind them. They injured at least 2 doing this, instead of dropping back to protect players and coaching staff.  During a speech by Cabrera about the Israel/Palestine issues, they forcibly detained a Muslim student because he had a picture of a mosque as his phone background.  Just recently, they’ve had pictures posted of their employees falling asleep when they should be checking/guarding bags at the career fair.  I know GTPD doesn’t have the resources to do crowd control for minor events, which sucks since they’re usually pleasant to deal with. GT needs to step up their game and quit paying bottom dollar contractors with lazy employees who are wannabe cops who couldn’t pass a psych eval. | Flair: Discussion\n",

That stuff doesn't normally bother me, it was going on last semester but this semester it just got way way worse. With this music playing all the way across the student center and someone rapping pretty graphically about fingerbanging, it's really a problem. Even more so because this was during the swim meet yesterday where hundreds of children are getting lunch at chick-fil-a, and kids are touring the school, its a really bad look for us.  I'd honestly like it if they just turned the music off entirely, because it's hard to study with that going on constantly, but please at least stop playing constant explicit music. | Flair: Rant\n",

Dear Apartment Management,  I'm writing to address two urgent issues in our apartment complex: a severe pest problem and a major trash problem. These problems have been going on for a month, and they need immediate attention.  The trash issue is out of control. The trash rooms on every floor are overflowing, the trash chutes are clogged, and trash is piling up everywhere up to the top floor. This is unsightly and unhygienic.  Flies have become a health concern, infesting the gym, hallways, and apartments, including kitchens, bedrooms, and bathrooms. This is unacceptable.  Please act immediately to resolve these problems: 1. Improve trash collection ASAP 2. Fix the clogged trash chute and dispose trash in trash rooms. 3. Call pest control (fly traps are not effective anymore)  Please respond promptly with your plan and timeline to address these issues. This is an urgent matter, and I appreciate your immediate attention. | Flair: Rant\n",
      "Negative post: Title: can the student center restaurants PLEASE change their menu setup 😫 + dining rant in general | Selftext: why does the menu need to revolve to show me non-food related things ? reminders to fill out the dining surveys can definitely just be posters on the wall… i literally had to wait awkwardly at the counter of the smoothie place so i could take a picture of each slide because the informative slides come and go so quick 😭 like tbh it doesn’t even make sense to have tv menus (except for test kitchen)  also the new pasta place has all these toppings but no sign for people to read so they can easily choose what they want… i just have to ask every time and hope i can remember everything they list off 🥴  plus why does panda express have no tofu options?? as the most popular asian restaurant on campus? it’s annoying that vegs can only go to $20 slutty vegan or twisted taco for a filling meal… and you have to pay extra to get the veggie “protein” option for the pasta place?? it’s not even meat it’s just boiled veggies!!  i miss the old stucen dining hall that only had all the big tables… it made it easier to find a place to eat bc it was acceptable to sit with random strangers— now i feel like i’m invading someone’s personal space for wanting to sit at a 6+ person table only 1 person is sitting at ! | Flair: Rant\n",
      "Negative post: Title: Academy of Medicine Parking Lot/PTS Rant | Selftext: PTS is horrible but this post isn't really about that, that's more than been discussed already. Instead I have something to say about the academy of medicine parking lot- could we please get the smallest amount of enforcement there, by both PTS and GTPD? The vast majority of the people that park there don't have passes/aren't paying according to a GTPD officer I talked to, and I don't think that's fair to people who do pay the ridiculous 800/yr for just one zone from 8-5. In addition, it's in a significantly more dangerous location than campus, so if anything it should be even more overpoliced than campus is. Although there's definitely something to complain about with having too many PTS people and false tickets and stuff that occurs on campus, the other side of that (nobody checking at all) is worse IMO. GTPD told me that's what's going on (nobody checks this lot) after I found my car broken into a couple days ago before heading to work, which although annoying I can't say I found surprising given that a parking space was filled with broken glass for an entire month before they cleaned it up earlier today (they had a summer start-up event today that they zoned the lot off for, figure that's what got them to finally clean it).   Obviously PTS gives no fucks about what people think (did anything ever happen as a result of that SGA investigation?), but hey maybe this will let students know that if they have a car with bulletproof windows they can park in that lot and not worry about getting ticketed. | Flair: Rant\n"
